This folder includes detailed descriptions of analysis procedures or scripts used for
transforming the raw data into processed data, for running the analyses, and for creating
figures and tables. Instructions for reproducing all analyses in the report can be included in
the README or in a separate instruction document in the this folder. If parts of the analyses
are computationally expensive, this folder can also contain intermediate (“cached”) results if
this facilitates fast (partial) reproduction of the original results. In the example project
(https://osf.io/xf6ug/), we provide the R Markdown file used to create the research report,
and cached results in the native R Data format. For convenience we also provide an R-script
version of the R Markdown file, which can be viewed in any text editor and directly executed
in R without rendering the manuscript.

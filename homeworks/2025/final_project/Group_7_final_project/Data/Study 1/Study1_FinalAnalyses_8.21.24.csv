6,Growing Risk to America's Seniors: Themselves; Government agencies attribute problem in part to isolation from families and communities,"Rising numbers of older adults are unable to care for themselves, often leading to serious health problems and even death, according to state and local government agencies. 
So-called self-neglect cases generally involve the inability to perform essential self-care, such as providing oneself with food, shelter, personal hygiene, medication and safety precautions. 
Seniors who no longer drive, for example, are often unable to get to medical appointments, exacerbating health problems that can render them incapable of caring for themselves. A fall can result in a hip fracture leaving one bedridden and unable to care for oneself. Failure to pay bills for the phone or other utilities could lead to service cutoffs. Forgetting to pay rent could lead to the loss of a home. 
Ralph and Marguerite McCormack, of Royal Palm Beach, Fla., incurred 29 fines for various property code violations between 2010 and 2018, totaling $433,962, according to local government documents, after neighbors complained for years about the unkempt state of their house, including rodent infestations and large appliances, furniture and toys cluttering their yard and filling a van in their driveway.  
Do you know someone at risk of ""self-neglect""? What would be a good way to go about getting an older 
adult assistance? Join the conversation below. 
Mr. McCormack, 75 years old, and his wife, 71, both had mental illness and stayed in hospitals during some of that time, unable to care for their property, said their lawyer, Jason Evans, in a recent interview. 
Despite repeated visits to their home by law-enforcement and state adult protective services officials, the McCormacks declined assistance, according to reports from the local sheriff's office. But after they were found living in their car parked outside their house-which had no running water and was strewn with human feces-in December 2017, officials removed them from their home and helped them settle in an assisted-living facility. 
The McCormacks are now asking the local village government to reduce the fines and remove its lien on their house so they can sell it to cover their living expenses. ""I have been in 35, 38 hospitals in six years... my wife was so messed up it was unbelievable,"" Mr. McCormack said during a July 2019 hearing before special magistrate. ""Now everybody is attacking me like a bunch of wolves."" 
The village manager, Ray Liggins, said Royal Palm Beach is willing to negotiate a settlement once a court- appointed guardian is installed to look after the couple's interest. 
Self-neglect cases involved 144,296 people across the country, accounting for more than half the reports of alleged elder abuse or neglect investigated by adult protective services programs in 2018, according to a new report released by the Department of Health and Human Services. That was more than the next five most numerous categories-neglect, financial exploitation, emotional abuse, physical abuse and sexual 
abuse-combined. 
The federal government doesn't have comparable data for previous years, but several state and local service providers say they are seeing the self-neglect problem swell, stretching their resources. Virginia's county and city programs, for example, investigated 18% more self-neglect cases in 2019 than in 2015. In the District of Columbia, such cases rose by 60% between fiscal years 2016 and 2019, according to the D.C. Department of Human Services. Iowa saw a 55% increase between fiscal years 2017 and 2019, while Ohio counted 19% more between fiscal years 2014 and 2019, according to state officials. 
Many professionals in the field believe the numbers understate the problem because just a fraction of self- neglect cases are reported as such. And they expect the figures to keep rising as the population ages and more seniors live alone. 
The reasons seniors stop caring for themselves vary, including illness, dementia, depression and poverty. The loss of the spouse or a neighbor who previously kept an eye on an individual often triggers a decline into self-neglect, experts say. 
About one in four Americans age 65 and older, or 14.3 million, lived alone in 2017, according to 
government data, up 31% from 10.9 million people in 2007. Those age 60 and over spend more than 10 hours of their daily measured time by themselves, compared with less than five hours for people in their 40s and 50s, according to the Pew Research Center. Daily measured time refers to all waking hours except those spent on personal activities such as grooming. 
""A lot of people end up getting very isolated in their homes,"" said Lori Delagrammatikas, executive director of the National Adult Protective Services Association, a group that represents state and local agencies assisting seniors and adults with disabilities experiencing abuse and other difficulties. ""That can cause a downward spiral."" 
Experts say the key to reducing self-neglect cases is providing services to enable seniors to remain in their homes safely, such as reliable transportation for medical appointments and grocery shopping, as well as affordable home help with chores and regular monitoring. 
Paige McCleary, Virginia's Adult Protective Services Division director, said agencies in her state try to help older adults who are struggling with self-care by arranging for cleanups or finding home-care services covered by Medicaid.

But in a small number of cases in which individuals are determined unable to live alone, the agency petitions a court to place them in short-term guardianship. 
""It's not uncommon that our workers face individuals who clearly can't manage themselves in their own homes but absolutely refuse to go to assisted living facilities or nursing homes,"" Ms. McCleary said.

8,A Musical Interlude From Isolation Over Skype: [Foreign Desk],"When Kevin Tang's American teacher found out he was stuck at home because of coronavirus, she decided 
to use music to improve his mood. 
Thirty minutes into the violin lesson, Anthea Kreston knew that something was wrong. 
Ms. Kreston, an acclaimed American violinist, was at home in Corvallis, Oregon. Her student, Yunhe Tang, a talented 14-year-old who prefers the name Kevin, was at his home in Chengdu, in southwest China. She had been giving Kevin violin lessons via Skype once a week since last August, but today something was different. Kevin seemed lethargic, like he hadn't practiced, and Kevin always practiced. 
""He said, 'Well, I'm not having lessons here, and I'm not going to school,"" Ms. Kreston said. ""And then he went, 'Everyone's sick."""" 
It did not take long for Ms. Kreston to realize Kevin's life had been affected by the coronavirus, even though he lived over 700 miles from Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. 
Chengdu is one of dozens of Chinese cities that are effectively on lockdown because of the virus. Schools are closed for the rest of the month and most businesses are struggling to reopen after being closed for weeks. Sichuan, the province of which Chengdu is the capital, had 436 confirmed cases of the virus as of Wednesday. 
Kevin's family remains healthy, but Kevin has mostly been stuck inside. 
Ms. Kreston said she couldn't stop thinking about Kevin shut up in the apartment, and decided to try and help take his mind off the virus. The day after the lesson earlier this month, she messaged Kevin and his family and asked if they would like to temporarily step up Kevin's lessons at no extra cost. As long as he was shut indoors, she wanted to have daily contact with him, and run a kind of violinist's boot camp during the coronavirus outbreak. The family agreed. 
Kevin's challenge would be to learn a new concerto -- Lalo's ""Symphonie Espagnole"" - in a few weeks, something she said would normally take 100 days. Ms. Kreston would also give him daily technical exercises to practice. She asked Kevin to record two videos a night to show he was doing the work, and 
send them to her. 
""When you go out of that door, I want you to have something to show to everybody, Ms. Kreston recalled telling Kevin. ""This is such a gift to you,"" -- she added, trying to put a positive spin on having more time to practice. ""You can come out the strongest player ever,"" she added. 
Kevin was scared when he first heard about the virus, he said in a Skype interview on Wednesday. ""I just wanted to wear my mask wherever I go, even when eating,"" he said with a laugh. 
He realized how serious the situation was at the end of January when the family's Lunar New Year vacation to Chongqing, a city in the middle of China, was canceled. Kevin had been looking forward to playing his violin loudly outside every day. Instead, he had stayed home, watched news reports about the virus, and became nervous. 
Kevin said the nerves passed quickly. His mother, who works at a hospital in Chengdu in its supplies department, told him as long as everyone's careful, they won't catch the virus. 
Two weeks into the boot camp with Ms. Kreston, he is feeling much better, but longs for the outdoors. He is able to go into his apartment's yard to play basketball, but he misses swimming and playing water polo and board games with friends. 
""I feel bored!"" he said while jumping from foot to foot as if filled with energy to burn. 
Although he is ""still very worried about Wuhan, Kevin said is not so concerned about his own city. He doesn't even worry about his mother, who has spent a lot of time recently buying masks and protective clothes for the hospital. ""We're often joking she's the most dangerous person in our home and we should keep her in the bathroom,"" he joked. 
Kevin's improved mood has a lot to do with the daily violin lessons with Ms. Kreston, he said. The two of them don't just share videos back and forth, but also emoji messages about his violin playing. 
Kevin now practices four hours every day, and he said his technique has improved and his sound has become more beautiful. Ms. Kreston said she gave Kevin the Lalo concerto because it was passionate at points and sad at others. Kevin could use it to tap into his feelings, even complicated ones about death and loss. 
""The virus is terrible,"" Kevin said, ""but music gives us the confidence to overcome.""",2/15/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9,Coronavirus Cabin Fever: Working From Home Tests Employees' Endurance; Days of isolation—or with the children underfoot; 'It's another full-time job trying to manage it all',"HONG KONG-As David Chang tried to talk on the phone with a colleague, his daughter banged away at the study-room door, and then, exasperated, slipped a note under it: She wanted to come in and do her homework. 
""Love you Avery. Love you Aidan. I'm on a call, the real-estate executive wrote back. 
His reply returned with the 6-year-old's response scribbled on the back: ""Why didn't you read my note?"" 
Many offices and schools have been closed since late January because of the coronavirus outbreak, and stress levels are rising at home. For the 40-year-old Mr. Chang, who rotates use of the room with his wife, also working from home, job duties such as conferring with contractors and developing strategy presentations had been joined by keeping their three children entertained. 
""It's another full-time job trying to manage it all,"" he said. 
Once an occasional break from the routine, working at home has become mandatory for millions of people in Hong Kong and mainland China as governments and companies try to limit spread of the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 70,000 in the region. 
Companies of all kinds have told many employees to work remotely and avoid contact with co-workers. Many plan to keep premises shut at least through February, though some allow essential workers to come in. The virus is also making hash of business travel. 
""It's a major test for companies everywhere about whether a flex arrangement can actually work,"" said Edmund Lee, executive director of the nonprofit Hong Kong Design Centre. Away from the office, internet connections are slower. With online meetings dominating, coordinating decisions take longer.

Some staffers lament working in isolation in small apartments, Mr. Lee said, so he checks in regularly, seeking to boost morale. Earlier this month, when Hong Kong supermarket shelves were stripped of some daily necessities by panic buying, he texted his team to ask if they had enough toilet paper. 
""I sympathize with people...a lot of the apartments here are not big, and if you have a lot of family members crammed in one place, it doesn't make life easy,"" Mr. Lee said. ""I'm trying to get them to stay encouraged."" 
In mainland China, many provinces and cities have imposed travel restrictions on citizens and quarantine requirements on visitors, effectively forcing people who went home to their families for the Lunar New Year holiday to stay put. 
Some government and company workers are finding creative ways to get their jobs done. A judge stuck in his home province of Hubei-center of the outbreak, where tens of millions of people are on lockdown- is presiding over civil cases in his courtroom hundreds of miles away in Suzhou via videoconference, a WeChat post from the court says. The post, which shows Judge Cheng Peng wearing a dark judicial robe borrowed from a local Hubei court, says he has already ruled on one loan-contract dispute. 
Work-from-home advisories from local governments have led to a surge in downloads of office software and networking apps that help businesses and workers stay connected. They offer platforms for online chats, document transfers and online meetings that can host hundreds of people at a time. 
The DingTalk app has been used for remote work by about six million companies, maker Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. estimated earlier this month. Fellow internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. said its WeChat Work is also being used by millions of companies, up sharply from a year ago. 
More than half of the participants in online meetings on one Tencent platform use a ""beautify"" function to enhance their faces with virtual makeup, or blur their backgrounds during video calls, the company said in an article posted on WeChat. DingTalk provides similar features. 
""The good thing about working from home is that as soon as you open your eyes, you can start to work,"" said Zhang Jing, who does marketing for Beijing-based Uncle Sam Education Group, which teaches English to local students. Not so good, she said, is that some people seem less conscious of the boundaries of the workday: Messages and assignments stream in at all hours. Her company has shifted many classes 
online because of the outbreak. 
Managers say they have to spend more time keeping employees engaged and connected. ""There is really a need to help people not feel too lonely,"" said Sebastien Gaudin, chief executive at Shanghai-based CareVoice. The insurance-technology startup, which has about 50 employees, holds daily meetings for 
staffers to talk through their tasks with team members.

One staffer quarantined in the southeast province of Zhejiang with only an iPhone as office equipment has been participating by drawing plans on paper and sharing snapshots of them with colleagues, said Mr. 
Gaudin. 
In Hong Kong, Charlotte Lam has mostly been working from home but has gone to her workplace in the financial district a few times to pick up mail and attend short meetings-including a job interview. 
""We just sat at the very edges of a really long conference table,"" said the 35-year-old office manager. Staying home and meeting online is complicated by her 4-year-old twins, who constantly demand her 
attention. 
Work disruptions may be manageable with technology in the short run, but Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said being unable to hold meetings, clients' inability to travel to the city and event cancellations are going to be problematic over the long run.

11,"Risks of Loneliness Among Seniors Aren't Being Adequately Addressed, Report Warns; Research shows social isolation is associated with increased chances for early death, advisory group says","WASHINGTON-The U.S. health system is falling short in addressing the serious public health threat of loneliness and social isolation among America's seniors, according to a new report by an influential advisory group. 
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said Thursday that nearly one-quarter of Americans aged 65 and older who live in community settings have few relationships or infrequent social contact. It concluded that four decades of research have produced robust evidence that social isolation is associated with a significantly increased risk for early death from all causes. 
""This is a major problem in our country that tends to go unrecognized,"" said Dan Blazer, chairman of the committee that produced the report and a professor emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University. In treating these conditions, ""there just is no evidence base in terms of what works and what does not,"" he added. 
The report calls for the Department of Health and Human Services to start a national resource center to treat the phenomenon, and for more research into what treatments work. It also encourages doctors and other health-care providers to periodically assess patients for signs of loneliness and social isolation, particularly after the death of a spouse or a move, and include their findings in patients' electronic health 
records. 
The report also suggested that existing Medicaid and private insurance programs that target so-called 
social determinants of health be reworked to address loneliness and social isolation. 
The authors cautioned about relying on newer technologies, such as social media and robots, to address the problem because they may in fact exacerbate it. ""The fear we had on the committee is that we're seeing a rapid advance in things like robotic animals that would substitute a real animal,"" Dr. Blazer said. ""We don't know what that does to the rest of the social environment."" 
Another concern is that many existing programs to combat loneliness and isolation rely on volunteers, grants and donations. ""This is an unsustainable financing model,"" the report said. 
Two years ago, the U.K. appointed a minister for loneliness, a move that caught the attention of the 
report's authors. Dr. Blazer said they didn't recommend creating that position in the U.S. because ""I'm not sure that type of thing works very well in the United States.""",2/27/20,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5
16,How I Made Self-Isolation Less Lonely: [Op-Ed],"Technology offers simple ways to help approximate the experience of being with others. 
As a self-employed writer, I often work at home, and have done so for years. This can be great -- 10-second commute! writing in pajamas! -- but comes with its own challenges. Some people get distracted and spend the day washing dishes, watering plants, organizing socks. Others suffer from having no one to report to. My personal demon is loneliness. After a day of struggling with a book chapter, a process that can feel like mud- wrestling a giant squid, the lack of company can leave me awfully bleak. That's why I joined a virtual co- working group. 
The idea is that at fixed times of the day, you log onto Zoom, Skype or some other tool for online video conferencing. Other people log on too, and after a couple of minutes of structured chat -- on which, more in a moment -- everyone hits ""mute"" on their microphones and the session begins. Video on, sound off. As I write this, I'm in a Zoom Room with two others; I can see them in the corner of my screen. Both have expressions of absorbed focus. I suspect that I do too. 
When I mention this to friends, some get it while others find the whole idea absurd. ""Wow, that's really postmodern,"" one said to me. ""Do you want to be watched?"" No, it's not the watching. It's the sense of camaraderie, the esprit de corps. 
The group I joined is run by a life-and-business coach, Megan Taylor Morrison. She created it for herself 18 months ago because she felt lonely working from home. ""Loneliness equates to less satisfaction, less productivity, less creativity,"" she said. ""Co-working helps keep me motivated."" She likes to start each session by asking everyone what they plan to work on and by posing some other question or challenge. ""What's your 
biggest distraction, and can you ignore it for the next two hours?"" ""What attitude do you want to bring to your work today?"" ""Where do you want to direct your power?"" The idea is that announcing intentions helps bring them to fruition. 
Each session runs for a set period -- an hour, two hours or more, depending on the day. At the end, everyone is invited to say briefly how they did. ""I totally rocked this project!"" ""I didn't finish, but I got into flow."" ""I set up three client calls."" ""I noticed that when I put my phone away, I got more done."" 
""You pay for this?"" the ""postmodern"" friend inquired, incredulous. Yes, because it's all set up. Before I joined the group, I had tried to enlist friends for something similar: It seemed obvious to me that having others virtually present would jolly me along, that their work and focus would create a synergy with mine and help me vanquish the giant squid. But the arrangements kept falling through. The time zones were awkward, someone had a dentist appointment, or, or, or. 
I've never met my co-workers in person. But I look forward to seeing them. I often use the sessions to take care of tasks with a clear beginning and end -- preparing a lecture, transcribing notes, giving feedback on a manuscript, doing German homework. The times are set up for people in the United States; I live in Europe, so they take place toward the end of my working day. At first, I thought this would be problematic, but in fact it provides a lift at the moment I am most likely to be besieged by despair. 
As the coronavirus spreads and more and more people retreat from public spaces, I foresee a Zoom Boom: Meeting in a Zoom Room will come to seem normal, not so much postmodern as postviral. Granted, it's not the same as grabbing coffee together in a cafe, and I, for one, hope those cafes won't become casualties of the disease. But on the plus side, you can put on the music you want to hear, and you don't have to feel isolated while working alone.",3/17/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
19,Home isolation is fertile ground for domestic abuse,"As the nation struggles to contain the spread of the coronavirus, vast numbers of Americans are being told to stay home. But what happens when home isn't safe? 
Where to get help 
If you are a victim of domestic violence, the National Domestic Violence Hotline allows you to speak confidentially with trained advocates online or by the phone, which they recommend for those who think their online activity is being monitored by their abuser (800-799-7233). They can help survivors develop a plan to achieve safety for themselves and their children. 
Safe Horizon's hotline offers crisis counseling, safety planning, and assistance finding shelters 1(800) 621- HOPE (4673). It also has a chat feature where you can reach out for help from a computer or phone confidentially. 
Survivors can also call the New York City Anti-Violence Project's 24/7 English/Spanish hotline at 212-714- 1141 and get support. If calling is not safe but email is possible, make a report at avp.org/get-help and leave safe contact information, and someone will reach out. 
Suicide Lifeline: If you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time of day or night or chat online. 
Crisis Text Line provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in crisis when they dial 
741741. 
For people who identify as LGBTQ, if you or someone you know is feeling hopeless or suicidal, you can also contact The Trevor Project's TrevorLifeline 24/7/365 at 1-866-488-7386. 
While social distancing benefits those most at risk of becoming seriously ill, experts say it will inevitably make others more vulnerable, including victims of domestic violence. 
""Because we are self-isolating, and particularly if the abusive person is self-isolating and has immediate proximity to the victim or survivor, there are various ways in which the risk element may go up,"" said Ruth Glenn, president of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""There are more means by which the abuser can abuse."" 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men in the U.S. have been victims of violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime, which it defines as rape, physical violence or stalking. Nearly 9 out of 10 incidents of family violence happens in the home of the victim or the home of a friend, relative or neighbor, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The majority of spouse violence occurs in the victim's home. 
Deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus have reached 115. In 2017, more than 2,237 people died in homicides at the hands of intimate partners. 
Domestic violence, experts say, is about power and control. In a pandemic, many people feel as though they're losing control and search for healthy ways to cope. But when an abuser feels powerless, it puts their 
victim at risk. 
Glenn says some abusers may use the COVID-19 outbreak to exert further control. They may discourage victims from leaving the house altogether. They may say it's not safe to go out with the kids, now home from school and more likely to witness abuse. Critical information sharing about the spread of the virus may be limited. 
""We're hearing concerns from people who are being isolated with their abusive partner because a lot of strategies that they use on a daily basis to survive the abusive relationship – their social network and support systems - they're going away,"" said Katie Ray-Jones, chief executive officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. 
""Their partners are telling them they can't see their friends or family because of potential exposure. Other partners are threatening to kick victims out and expose them to COVID-19."""" 
Ray-Jones said a woman who called the hotline said her abusive partner doesn't believe in medical treatment, so he's forcing her to wash her hands each day until they're raw. A teen girl called because she's terrified to become quarantined with her mother and her mother's abuser. She typically gets support from her school counselor, but now school is closed. 
Many victims of domestic violence already experience social isolation. Abusers often forbid victims from communicating with their families and friends. Certain populations are especially vulnerable, experts say, including rural people, communities of color and people who identify as LGBTQ, who research shows experience domestic violence at equal or even higher rates compared with their heterosexual counterparts. 
Low-income survivors are especially vulnerable during the outbreak, experts say. As restrictions tighten, many low-wage workers are seeing their jobs disappear. Many don't have access to paid sick leave. Survivors who may have secretly been storing money for an apartment to escape to will be impacted. 
""It's great that everyone is supporting health care workers and emergency services workers, but it's not always on the top of people's minds that domestic violence shelters, homeless shelters, youth foster care programs, that these types of services also must continue to run,"" said Janice Miller, director of programs and clinical services at House of Ruth Maryland, a full-service intimate partner violence organization. ""That's where very vulnerable individuals are living, and we know trauma has an impact on immunity."" 
Miller said House of Ruth made the decision early on not to close its emergency shelter or its 24/7 hotline. 
Domestic violence experts say governments and communities can help protect victims during the pandemic by continuing to ensure access to emergency services and the courts. In the absence of funding and support, many smaller shelters are facing difficult decisions about whether they can remain open. LGBTQ survivors may be hit particularly hard if services dwindle. 
""LGBTQ folks face bias and discrimination when attempting to access shelter, particularly domestic violence shelter, which is typically geared towards cisgender straight women fleeing violence from their cisgender straight male partners,"" said Eliel Cruz, communications director at the New York City Anti- Violence Project. ""At this time, shelter is even harder to access for everyone, which makes it more challenging for LGBTQ folks."" 
Kimberlina Kavern, senior director of the crime victim assistance program at Safe Horizon, a victim services nonprofit organization, said it's essential all survivors be able to get the help they need. 
""Services need the resources and ability to stay open,"" Kavern said. 
Kavern said it's also essential workers have access to paid sick leave, especially for hourly workers and those in the service industry, and assurance that public benefits will continue on time. 
Ray-Jones said some victims are leaving shelters and returning to their abusers because of fears of infection, but experts stress open shelters have protocols in place for crises and are disinfecting and spacing to keep people as safe as possible. Many of the other services domestic violence organizations provide - such as mental health counseling and job programs - are shifting online to mitigate risk. 
― 
Ray-Jones says she's concerned that even if services are offered remotely, strict isolation measures may mean that many victims won't access them. Victims typically seek help when their abusers aren't around. But the restrictions around COVID-19 mean many victims are constantly with their abusers. 
She says victims should start to plan ahead before restrictions tighten further. 
""Time is of the essence, and we need people to be thinking through these strategies before they are locked down and sheltering in place and can't access help safely, Ray-Jones said. ""Now is a good time to reach out to the hotline and talk to an advocate who can tailor a safety plan to your unique situation."" 
Glenn says victims should do what's safe for them. Organizations are working hard to ensure help is there 
if and when a victim needs it. 
""If you are planning to reach out, please don't let COVID-19 prevent you from doing that,"" Glenn said. ""Domestic violence shelters and programs are creatively and safely doing their best to make sure they are 
there for survivors.""",3/19/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5
21,"Two Books on Solitude: They Want to Be Alone; We seem either to mock or idolize solitaries, perhaps because perceiving them as ordinary might require us to question the cocoon of noise with which we surround ourselves.","In the United States, the home of rugged individualism, more than 28% of households consist of a single person. Yet solitude continues to have a poor reputation. 
Two thoughtful new books set out to change that. ""The Art of Solitude,"" by Stephen Batchelor, a scholar of Buddhism, takes an inward view of the subject, chronicling the author's lifetime of meditation practice, solitary retreats and experiments with mind-altering substances. ""At the Center of All Beauty,"" by the Catholic author and scholar Fenton Johnson, takes a more expansive approach, offering capsule biographies of a dozen or so writers, artists and performers who drew on solitude in different ways to power their creative expression. 
The Art of Solitude 
By Stephen Batchelor Yale, 181 pages, $23 
At the Center of All Beauty 
By Fenton Johnson Norton, 236 pages, $26.95 
Elegant and formally ingenious, ""The Art of Solitude"" presents 32 essays on aspects of solitude. Some describe Mr. Batchelor's experience of meditation in places as far-flung as India, South Korea and Mexico. A few are about his engagement with Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century pioneer of the personal 
essay and sometime recluse. Some recount the insights drawn from his use of body-racking, vision- inducing drugs such as mescaline and ayahuasca. 
The essays echo and comment on one another, and they also echo the book's appendix, Mr. Batchelor's translation from the Pali language of a sequence of poems that he calls ""Four Eights."" Mr. Batchelor cites an earlier translator's opinion that these four poems, each 32 lines long, make up the core of the 2,400- year-old Buddhist text ""Sutta Nipāta"" and ""might be the earliest record of the Buddha's teaching"" 
The book as a whole resists falling into a narrative or argument. ""None of its thirty-two chapters, writes Mr. Batchelor, ""is ever preceded or followed by a chapter that treats the same theme."" To build a case for the value of solitude would, the author seems to feel, be declassé. 
Finishing ""The Art of Solitude,"" it's easy to feel that one must have a Ph.D. in ancient languages, a strong stomach and the money and leisure to seek out stone towers in distant lands if one wants to be properly solitary. And even then, the results may not be worth the effort. 
""Over the years,"" writes Mr. Batchelor, ""I must have spent many thousands of hours seated on a meditation cushion, but I still get distracted, listless, and bored. . . . There can be long periods when I do not meditate formally at all. Often I feel like a dilettante."" 
If this is discouraging, it might help to turn to ""At the Center of All Beauty,"" a more flexible and forgiving approach to the subject of solitude. Rather than suggesting that the benefits of solitude come only with suffering and deep study, this book serves up encouragement to the would-be solitary and offers examples of the many ways solitude can structure our lives. 
As a seventh-grade student in a Catholic school in Kentucky, Fenton Johnson was asked to draw a picture of something from the catechism. The result was ""Three Roads to Heaven,"" in which three paths diverge toward the Religious Life, Marriage, and ""a cloud labeled SINGLE, which our catechism offered as a legitimate calling, officially on a par with the other two options."" 
If Catholic teaching suggested that being alone was OK, a real-life example came from the nearby Abbey of Gethsemani, where Trappist monks lived and worked in silence, and Thomas Merton wrote his acclaimed memoir ""The Seven Storey Mountain"" and many other books. Mr. Johnson decided early that he was ""not the marrying kind,"" a decision only partly determined by the fact that he was gay. 
Mr. Johnson maintains that solitude is particularly important to the creators among us. He makes his case by sketching the lives of a select company of artistic solitaries, beginning with Henry David Thoreau, the famous hermit of Walden Pond. 
Just kidding. Thoreau was no hermit, as Mr. Johnson well understands. ""The notion of Thoreau as a hermit,"" he writes, ""is so far from the facts that what's curious is why it developed in the first place, since Walden is replete with anecdotes of chatty visits from townspeople and travelers."" Thoreau surely valued the time he spent by himself. He wrote, ""I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude."" But it was not the only time he valued. 
""I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there,"" he wrote after his two years, two months and two days in the little house he built himself. ""Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives to live and could not spare any more time for that one."" 
Mr. Johnson sheds some light on why Thoreau has taken so much flak from critics for failing to be the self-sufficient hermit that he never said he was. ""The reasons for that discrediting, I argue, arise from our need to savage solitaries who so emphatically and cheerfully break social norms, because they show how easily it may be done... We seem either to mock (Thoreau) or idolize (Thomas Merton) those who seek and enjoy solitude, perhaps because perceiving them as ordinary folks might require us to question the cocoon of noise and artificial light with which we surround ourselves and that constitutes contemporary life."" 
Though Mr. Batchelor is steeped in the Buddhist tradition and Mr. Johnson in the Catholic Church, there is considerable crossover in their thinking about solitude. Mr. Batchelor is a great admirer of Montaigne, who sought to build a bridge between Catholics and Protestants only to have his volumes of essays placed on the Index of Prohibited Books for nearly 300 years. Mr. Johnson has less to say about Buddhism than Mr. Batchelor says about Catholicism, but he does note that ""the Buddha and Jesus sacrificed their comfortable and secure lives to cultivate solitude, leaving their homes and taking to the road."" And yet he warns that ""as the Buddha and Hebrew biblical prophets point out repeatedly, idols are an avoidance mechanism, a place where we can park and abandon our dreams instead of accepting our responsibility to live them out."" 
Both Mr. Batchelor and Mr. Johnson believe in the value of solitude for the creative life. Indeed, that is the main subject of Mr. Johnson's book, in which we learn how people as different as the painter Paul Cézanne, the novelist Zora Neale Hurston, the singer Nina Simone and the street photographer Bill Cunningham built cells of solitude within their lives and drew out different kinds of treasure. But Mr. Batchelor, for his part, also traces the roots of artistic achievement to solitude. In John Keats's sonnet ""O Solitude!,"" the poet seeks out hills ""where the deer's swift leap / Startles the wild bee from the foxglove bell."" Though Keats was no Buddhist, Mr. Batchelor sees an echo of nirvana in the concept of ""negative capability,"" in which one ""is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason."" 
Drugs and sexuality are two areas where these authors have less in common. There is nothing in Mr. Johnson's book to set beside Mr. Batchelor's descriptions of taking ayahuasca in Andalusia: ""My mind is invaded by spiraling patterns of color. I vomit diminishing amounts of a bitter liquid, my body repeatedly convulsing, sweat dripping off my face, my nostrils filled with the vegetal stench of the medicine, until I 
pass out."" 
Similarly, there is nothing in Mr. Batchelor's book to set beside Mr. Johnson's thoughtful exploration of how discovering that one is ""not the marrying kind""-whether that means being gay or not-can be the path to the sort of career that Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Henry James or Eudora Welty enjoyed. 
Both these books are essentially pro- solitude, perhaps in reaction to the anti-solitude prejudices of Western culture. But both authors would surely recognize that too much solitude, like too much of anything, can be just too much. As the solitary short-story writer E.I. Lonoff remarks about Nathan Zuckerman in Philip Roth's ""The Ghost Writer"" (perhaps remembering his Keats), ""I was only suggesting- surmising is more like it-that an unruly personal life will probably better serve a writer like Nathan than walking in the woods and startling the deer.""",3/20/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,both risks and benefits,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,2,0
24,"How isolation can impact your mood, and what to do about it","As more Americans are encouraged to practice social distancing and to work from home, less person-to- person contact can negatively impact mental wellness. 
Deciding whether to visit family, have loved ones over, or leave the house for any reason is a real concern since President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus March 13. 
Andrea Graham, an assistant professor of medical social sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said it is hard to live in a space of uncertainty. 
""That's very challenging for people to be wrestling with those kinds of decisions, and whether to be with loved ones,"" she said. ""These kinds of moments can lead to ... waves of ups and downs of emotions."" 
Joe Sislow, a Portage Park resident, said he and his wife, Lori Gentile, have been going back and forth on 
whether to visit her mother in northwest Indiana. 
""We're totally weighing the calculus on this,"" he said. ""Because odds are in a week, or two weeks, it's going to be worse."" 
With schools, bars and restaurants closing, so much feels in flux. Gentile runs a comic book store, Amazing Fantasy, in Frankfort, Illinois, that she might have to close for a while, said Sislow. 
""She'll probably go stir crazy; she's been doing that for 30 years,"" he said. 
The coronavirus pandemic is eliminating the normalcy of daily activities, and that can be difficult to cope 
with. 
On March 15, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended gatherings with 50 or more people be canceled or postponed for the next eight weeks, and that events of any size adhere to the guidelines ""for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing."" It also suggested more events go virtual. 
""We like to go to estate sales, we like to go to museums, we like to go out to see shows, Sislow said. And now many of those activities are no longer an option for him and his wife. 
Graham suggests ensuring regular contact with family members and friends, even if it is not face-to-face. Utilize FaceTime to connect, she said, or make sure to speak on the phone. 
""Those are really important ways to buffer against some of that loneliness and sadness that can creep up,"" 
she said. 
If you're working remotely, call or video chat with a co-worker. It can help lessen some of the social isolation because, for many, conversations with co-workers are a nice part of the work day. 
""We don't typically quantify that when we go into work every day, but that's part of the routine that's important,"" Graham said. 
View time at home as a positive. Focus on connecting with your family. Pick up that hobby you have been considering, or take on that home project you've put off. 
And make a routine. 
Wake up at the same time, go to bed at the same time. 
Pay attention to how you are feeling. If you are more anxious, Graham suggests taking a break from the news. ""Practice some relaxation activities,” she says. Do things you enjoy, such as listening to music, reading a book, or calling a friend. 
In the CDC's tips for mental wellness, it noted that people who might respond more strongly to the stress of a crisis include children and teens, those with preexisting mental health conditions and substance abuse problems, or those helping with the response, such as health care providers or first responders. 
Reactions can include fear and worry about one's own health status and their loved ones; changes in sleep or eating patterns; difficulty concentrating; increased use of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs and worsening of chronic health problems. 
People with preexisting mental health conditions should continue their treatment plans, the CDC suggested. 
The agency also advised avoiding excessive exposure to media coverage and encouraged deep breaths, stretching and meditation. Eat well. Exercise regularly. 
""Remind yourself that strong feelings will fade,"" the CDC guidance advised. ""It can be upsetting to hear 
about the crisis and see images repeatedly. Try to do some other activities you enjoy to return to your normal life.""

25,"Eating alone, together: Breaking bread virtually is helping people fight isolation","As the coronavirus outbreak has driven people into their homes, whether because of a quarantine or just to help ""flatten the curve, a haunting set of images began circulating on social media. 
""We are all Edward Hopper paintings now,"" one user wrote, accompanying the message with paintings of the American realist artist famous for his portrayals of alienation, often populated by solitary figures in spaces that are typically the sites of conviviality, such as restaurants and cafes. 
And many of us do feel like Hopper's lonely people. Not being able to share meals with friends and family, to gather at others' tables or pull up more chairs to our own, has been one of the most disconcerting effects of the coronavirus. But just as those weekly work meetings have become virtual, the communal meal lives on. 
Many people have turned to platforms like Zoom and Google Hangouts for happy hours: Friends, each with their choice of ""quarantini"" drink in hand, gab from little boxes on one another's screens. And still others have taken it further and are making appointments to break bread together in groups big and small. 
Connor Ferguson, a writer from Somerville, Mass., has been holed up at home with his wife, venturing out only to go for walks or to the grocery store. But on Tuesday, he dined with more than 20 members of his extended family. The virtual dinner party was his wife's idea, and it took off as soon as she proposed it. In the end, eight households from Nashville to Chicago participated. Everyone made pasta with red sauce. 
""It just felt good to maintain that feeling of connection,"" he says. 
So much of the anxiety in this crisis has centered around food. Restaurants are closing, supermarket shelves are emptying, and so many of our questions are about sustenance: Have we filled our cupboards with the right canned goods, and what do we make for dinner tonight? 
How fitting, then, that eating together, even in different houses in far-flung cities, has been a balm. 
In London, Caroline Fiennes's tennis group usually meets on Wednesdays at their club for matches, and then many of them stick around for dinner afterward. This week, taking the regular dinner date online has helped her feel like not everything in life has been upended, even as tube stations closed and rumors swirled about a city lockdown. Four members of the group logged on at the appointed time, with several of them eating together. ""We had a nice chat - it was the usual random nonsense we talk about,"" says Fiennes, an adviser on philanthropic giving. ""We're going to have to find ways to do the normal social things, or else we're all going to go mad."" 
Holidays are when families and friends gather for shared meals, and with Easter and Passover on the horizon, many families are looking for ways to adapt their traditional gatherings. Ben Shlesinger, who does government relations for the American Kidney Fund, and his family usually go to his parents' home in Silver Spring, Md., for Passover. His mother has cooked the Seder dinner for as long as he can remember, making brisket, chicken, matzo ball soup and kugel with cheese and raisins. This year, they won't be there, but his mom came up with the idea of FaceTiming the grandchildren as she cooks at least some of the traditional dishes. His 3-year-old daughter will watch from their home in Rockville, and so will his niece in New York, who is ""completely obsessed"" with cooking, he says. 
Shlesinger says that as parents of two young children, he and his wife are used to a limited social life. ""But not being able to have family get-togethers - that's what's really missing for us,"" he says. 
- 
Because virtual hangouts involve technology, there are often glitches. Not everyone makes use of the mute button when they should, and conversation doesn't flow like it would in person. Ferguson and his wife also had a recent online dinner with his uncle and aunt (each household made burgers), and they found that four was a manageable number. But for their big family dinner, they tried a more directed approach, playing a couple rounds of the game 20 Questions. Then they went around and had people, one by one, talk about who they would vote for in the Democratic primary. Someone suggested that they each say what their greatest hope was. 
Fiennes is weighing whether, for future virtual meals with her tennis group, participants should have a phone with them so that if they wanted to break into side conversations, they could. However their gatherings evolve, she's certain that she and her friends will get better at it. ""We have months and months to perfect this,"" she says. 
Fiennes, who considers herself a very social person, imagines that as the weeks of isolation wear on, the dinner parties could get ever more elaborate, just for the sake of diversion. She's planning to ""get together"" with college friends on Saturday for a dinner, and there's talk of having everyone cook the same recipe, so they can compare their efforts. ""At some point, it will be like, 'We're having a posh dinner, everybody dress up!'"" she says. 
There's plenty of advice against dining alone. It's been linked to depression, obesity and other physical conditions. And the Greek philosopher Epicurus once wrote that ""a dinner of meats without the company of a friend is like the life of a lion or a wolf."" Not that everyone is eating all alone these days - plenty of 
people are at home with families, spouses or roommates - but even a limited number of dining companions can make people feel lonesome. 
Alice Julier, a sociologist and the author of ""Eating Together,"" says being forced to dine at home has been good in some ways: It's made people more aware of their dependence on restaurants and more conscious of the labor involved in putting food on the table. But depriving people of the ability to eat communally goes against our nature, she says. ""We don't feel good in isolation, most of us,"" she says. ""We've organized our 
whole world around social contact."" 
And sharing food is a natural way to maintain such connections, even in these weird times. Setting up virtual dinner dates, Ferguson says, takes away some of the potential awkwardness of asking people to sit down and do a video chat with you. ""Situating it around a meal makes it feel more natural - in a completely unnatural situation,"" he says.",3/23/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,2,2
28,"The worst is yet to come'; Isolation could raise the risk of domestic abuse; Experts say seclusion, stress from pandemic may worsen already strained relationships.","One evening last week, a 38-year-old woman showed up in the emergency room of a Los Angeles hospital. She had been beaten by her boyfriend. 
Under normal circumstances, the hospital would contact a domestic violence advocate, who would meet with the woman in person and help her find shelter and other services. But that night, because of limitations on visitors and health guidelines due to COVID-19, an advocate had to connect by phone. 
About a dozen calls later, the woman was placed in a shelter. 
""We got lucky this time,"" said Yvette Lozano, the chief program and operating officer for Peace Over Violence, a nonprofit focused on ending interpersonal relationship violence. ""It's really hard to find an immediate placement for someone in need."" 
Lozano and other advocates worry that the changes to everyday life brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic -- stay-at-home mandates, job losses and school closures -- may worsen already strained relationships, leading to increased rates of domestic abuse. Others are concerned that those who are suffering may be less inclined to report a crime or reach out for help. 
""For someone who is in an abusive relationship, this is kind of a worst-case scenario,"" said Alyson Messenger, a managing staff attorney with the Jenesse Center, a domestic violence organization based in South Los Angeles. ""Compound that with the fact that access to services is more difficult than ever."" 
This nightmare for domestic violence victims has already played out elsewhere. The number of such incidents in China has risen sharply as people across much of that country have been quarantined, according to Chinese news sources. 
Already, the National Domestic Violence Hotline has begun to field some highly distressing calls as quarantine measures have been implemented, said the hotline's chief executive, Katie Ray-Jones. 
One woman said her partner threatened to throw her out onto the street if she showed any symptoms of COVID-19. Another said her partner vowed to prevent her from seeking medical care if she became sick. 
Al Provinziano, a family lawyer in Los Angeles, said calls to his firm related to domestic violence doubled last week. 
""People are saying that they can't believe they'll be stuck with their abuser, and that they don't know how they're going to get through this period of quarantine,"" Provinziano said. 
The idea that stress and isolation lead to higher rates of domestic violence is not new. During the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009, the National Domestic Violence Hotline fielded many calls from those in long-term abusive relationships who said the violence against them had grown more intense, said Ray- 
Jones. 
Research has found a relationship between natural disasters and increased rates of interpersonal violence, especially among households that experience significant financial strain. After Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm that made landfall in South Florida in 1992, spousal- abuse calls to Miami's helpline increased by 50%, researchers found. In L.A., advocates saw domestic violence rise in the aftermath of the 1994 Northridge earthquake. 
The concern isn't that quarantine will cause normally peaceful partners and parents to suddenly become abusive. Rather, it's likely that widespread isolation and stress-inducing conditions -- such as job loss and feelings of helplessness -- will increase the number and severity of such incidents in households that have already seen a cycle of violence, advocates say. 
""Domestic violence is rooted in power and control,"" Ray-Jones said. ""When an abuser loses that power control, they tend to exert or take that out on the victims in their relationship."" 
At the same time, survivors will be less able to break away from the surveillance of their abusers. And those who might have stayed with aging parents are less likely to do so now, as the elderly are far more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. 
It's estimated that more than 10 million people experience domestic violence in the U.S. each year, and the number of homicides related to domestic violence has been on the rise since 2010. In L.A. County, as overall homicides have declined, the number of women slain has steadily risen. 
Income loss might also make it more difficult for victims to leave. Someone who has saved money in order to execute an escape plan may now be forced to use that cash in the face of job loss or a reduction in 
hours. 
And when victims of domestic violence aren't out in the community, the red flags of abuse are less likely to be noticed by friends and family members. 
""We get reports through schools or hospitals that somebody has had a physical injury, but kids aren't going to school right now, and people are avoiding hospitals,"" said Tara Peterson, executive director of the YWCA 
of Glendale. 
The East Los Angeles Women's Center uses hundreds of trained promotoras, women who educate their communities about healthy relationships, to connect with those in East and South Los Angeles who are most at risk for violence, said Barbara Kappos, the center's executive director. Now, the women can't meet weekly and in-person to help those who may be the most resistant. 
In response to COVID-19, the Los Angeles Police Department last week closed front desks and walk-up services to ""ensure social distancing,"" a move that worried those who work with victims and depend on police to report abuse. 
The county courts are still open for essential functions, which include processing petitions for emergency domestic-violence restraining orders. Judges may still issue emergency protective orders at the request of law enforcement, which can lead to the temporary removal of an abuser from a home. 
If victims are seeking a temporary restraining order or an emergency protective order, they can go to their local stations and will be assisted, said LAPD Assistant Chief Robert Arcos in an email. 
Each station has a night-watch detective available to assist domestic violence victims, he said, and teams that respond to such incidents will continue to be deployed. As of Monday, Arcos said, he hadn't seen an increase in calls for service. 
Meanwhile, organizations that provide services to domestic violence victims and survivors in L.A. County are forced to be creative in serving their clients. 
In-person support groups have been replaced by virtual ones. Therapists are deploying code words with their clients to keep them safe. Although many shelters are full across the county, hotlines are available. 
Patti Giggans, executive director of Peace Over Violence, said her staff of about 70 is working remotely. Counseling and staff meetings have been conducted virtually. 
""We're committed to not abandoning any people who are on our caseloads,"" she said. 
Carmen McDonald, director of legal services at the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice, worries that victims now will be less likely to seek services. Already, she said, she's seeing a decline in new clients and requests for legal assistance. 
""We know what is going on with our clients, but we don't know what's going on with the other folks who 
need services,"" she said. 
It is still uncertain how shelters for victims of domestic violence will be affected by the pandemic. But some warn that it may become increasingly difficult to find a spot at an emergency shelter. 
Elizabeth Eastlund, executive director of Rainbow Services in San Pedro, said the organization's transitional and emergency shelters are full and aren't cycling people in and out due to the uncertainty of the pandemic. If clients don't have a solid plan for where they will go next, they're not leaving. 
Peterson said the YWCA of Glendale's small shelter for domestic violence victims is open and a handful of its 12 beds are available. The YWCA will provide vouchers for hotel rooms once the shelter is full. 
The Glendale shelter is not screening residents for the coronavirus but does have a designated, private space for anyone presenting COVID-19 symptoms. 
Though organizations that help survivors do not expect to halt services anytime soon, the pandemic has already affected their finances. The YWCA of Glendale had to cancel its biggest fundraiser, scheduled for April. 
""We rely on that money to be able to be nimble and provide additional resources,"" Peterson said. ""We are monitoring the situation daily, but we're concerned about being fully operational if this goes on longer than a couple of months.""",3/25/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2
37,Double-edged sword of isolation: Social distancing helps flatten virus curve but it also might hurt those in sobriety,"Social isolation helps limit the spread of COVID-19 and saves lives, but paradoxically might put people - especially those with substance-use disorders and mental health conditions - at higher risk of death due to drug overdose, alcohol poisoning and suicide. In January, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that more Americans were dying from so-called ""deaths of despair"" than at any other point in history, and the last time we used words like ""pandemic"" and ""crisis,"" we were talking about opioids. 
Federal surveys suggest that about half of U.S. adults experience an anxiety or depressive disorder at some point in their lives. That percentage will surely jump in the next year or two, and regardless of where you fit into that equation, virtually everyone is feeling anxious, stressed, frightened and worried in ways they 
haven't before. 
Throw in health concerns about at-risk family members, dwindling retirement accounts, potential job losses, food scarcity and the threat of civil unrest and you have the makings of yet another public health 
crisis that could claim thousands of lives. 
At the Family and Children's Association, we've already heard from local residents who are stockpiling heroin in case street availability changes, and drug counselors are getting calls from addicted folks whose drug supply has been limited by loss of income and access to dealers and who are now fighting severe flu-like withdrawal symptoms alone. 
While some of our neighbors are posting funny social media memes about how much wine it will take to survive being quarantined with their kids, lots of people in recovery are scared to death that they'll pick up their first drink in years. 
Families confined with an addicted loved one in their homes are holding on for dear life, as are those who are prone to depression and other mental health disorders. Wondering whether you'll be able to get your psychiatric medications if your doctor's office closes or your pharmacy is overwhelmed, whether your depression will deepen and prompt suicidal thoughts, or whether you'll start hearing voices again, is a difficult way to live. 
It's even tougher when social distancing leads your support group - with all its rituals, affirmations and group hugs - to be banned from meeting in the church basement, your trusted social worker who knows your story is self-quarantining, hospital beds are being saved for COVID-19 victims at risk for imminent death, and it might seem easier to get a case of booze delivered than it is to get a mental health clinic appointment. 
Many community organizations and treatment providers are still offering essential face-to-face services conducted with proper precautions. With federal and state governments suspending regulations that were barriers to care, we've also moved support groups to virtual environments, are now conducting counseling sessions via phone or video, and are proactively reaching out to those most at risk more often than ever before. Whether that will be enough to adequately protect those at risk and stave off a series of post- pandemic aftershocks is unclear. 
It's probably not, and our collective willingness to take a few steps now could flatten the coronavirus curve and save lives later. You should absolutely call, text or video chat with someone who might be struggling. But you should also check in with yourself, take stock of how you are feeling, and replace 24/7 news coverage and social media with things that promote relaxation, balance, peace and joy, because let's face it, anxiety, stress and worry could be as contagious as coronavirus.

40,"CORONAVIRUS; Could COVID-19 make isolation the new normal? A global social experiment, through a Seoul lens","Before dawn, bags of groceries ordered online are plopped at my front door by deliverymen (women?) whose faces I'll never see. 
I summon taxis on my smartphone, rendering unnecessary even the brief conversation to give the driver my destination or discuss an optimal route. All manners of food -- from steaming stews to sushi to the seemingly most ephemeral of dishes, shaved ice -- can be ordered for delivery within the hour. If I so choose, I can avoid even a split-second of face time by requesting, in an app, that the food be left outside my door. 
In Seoul, one of the most densely packed metropolises in the world, I can glide through a day dining out, shopping and even singing karaoke on my own without ever interfacing with another human. My world is one of apps, tablets and self-service screens. It's almost as if the city was girding itself for this moment in history, when each and every face-to-face interaction has come to feel like a game of Russian roulette. 
Long before the virus' arrival, social distancing was becoming a way of life in my native South Korea, as it was around a globe increasingly accustomed to same-day shipping, on-demand service apps and more streamed entertainment than one could watch in a lifetime. The precision and convenience of drop-down menus and electronic payments have taken the place of in-person transactions; the allure of algorithm- optimized content and infinitely replenishing social media has come to trump the less sure bet of flesh- and-blood company. 
The coronavirus, in forcing a swath of humanity to shelter in place for weeks on end, may very well accelerate that digital sequestration and seal us more deeply in the glow of our screen-enabled confines. 
It's a grand social experiment of an unprecedented scale. When we emerge from weeks or months of distancing from one another, will we crave and relish human contact, or realize how comfortably we can live without it? What will that do to us? 
""I think this will become the new normal,"" said Koo Bon-kwon, a South Korean columnist and author who writes about how technology has changed human lives. ""A chunk of our society will experience this for the first time and realize, there isn't a whole lot of difference to workflow, productivity and performance"" 
It's long been the paradox of urban living that the closer we're packed together, the more anonymous and alienated we become. The novel coronavirus has added to even the most fleeting of interactions a sense of peril, changing the risk-benefit calculus of the minute, mundane human encounters that thread our daily lives. Will that exchange with the store clerk, that brush on the subway, that elevator ride be the fateful moment the invisible virus makes its entry? 
The shelter-in-place and 6-feet physical distancing measures unfolding across the U.S. have left many anxious about the indefinite period of isolation ahead. News reports are asking everyone from astronauts to inmates in long-term solitary confinement for tips on how to persevere. 
But nestled in front of our TV screens and scrolling through our smartphones, weren't we increasingly living that way already? 
Isolation has for years been both a cultural trend and marketing buzzword in South Korea and elsewhere in East Asia. The once-robust family ties in these societies are fraying. Rapid urbanization and cut-throat economic competition have left a generation fatigued by interacting with fellow denizens. 
In Japan, ""low-interaction dining"" for lone diners, facilitated by automated ticketing machines and cubicle- like partitions, had long since become a fixture of city life. 
In China, consultants in recent years published reports on the ""Economy of Loneliness, extolling business opportunities to cater to a generation more comfortable spending time alone than in the company of 
others. 
In South Korea, increasing numbers of young adults had been self-identifying as "" honjok"" -- loosely translated to ""tribe of loners,"" people who prefer solitude. 
Businesses realized more and more people preferred services devoid of human contact, and would even pay a premium for it. They began offering up what's come to be known here as ""untact"" services, a neologism combining ""undo"" and ""contact,"" popularizing self-service auto financing, coffee served up by robot-arm baristas and unmanned, self-pay karaoke stalls. 
In the U.S. and Europe, there's been increasing alarm about the health consequences of loneliness, with researchers calling loneliness itself an ""epidemic."" But in Asia, time alone for some has come to be celebrated and cherished as a revolt against a collectivist tradition and something of a liberation for a generation of young adults. 
Jeong Dan-bi runs a start-up providing information and services for the honjok -- such as cocktail recipes to make at home, and where to get shabu shabu for one. She said the ""loner"" phenomenon was about prioritizing one's own time and preference in defiance of a rigid corporate and working culture that limits 
individual expression. 
""We were probably able to accept [social distancing] more easily because that culture was already spreading, especially among millennials,"" said Jeong, 31, chief executive of the company King of Honjok. 
Since the coronavirus outbreak, there's been a twofold surge in sign-ups for her app, Jeong said. She noted that in South Korea, there had been negative views of the trend from the older generation casting it as youthful selfishness, but that may shift with the coronavirus outbreak. 
""A monumental event like this will really change people's perceptions,"" she said. ""People across generations were forced to experience it. There are going to be people who think, now that I've tried it out, I like it."" 
Despite an early surge of coronavirus infections in February -- with the largest number of infected outside China at one point -- South Korea never imposed mandatory business closures or large-scale quarantines. Instead it urged citizens to voluntarily distance themselves for two weeks. Combined with extensive contact tracing and widespread testing, the approach appeared to stabilize the community spread, with the number of new infections leveling off in recent weeks. 
A newspaper op-ed this month credited South Korea's legions of delivery workers as the unsung heroes who had allowed life in the country to largely go on even as cities elsewhere went on lockdown. Amid a surge in orders, a deliveryman in his 40s with a heart condition collapsed and died on the job in the early hours of March 12. 
""It is not an exaggeration to say, doctors are on the front lines fighting the coronavirus and protecting our lives, while in the rear, deliverymen are protecting people struggling to keep their distance from the virus,"" an op-ed in the newspaper Joongang Ilbo said. 
While the possibility of a second wave of cases from travelers and students returning from abroad remains, Seoul is in a thaw. In time for the spring bloom, Jeong's office reopened after about two weeks of telecommuting. Koo, the columnist, who writes for the Hankyoreh newspaper, has begun setting up the occasional lunch appointment after about a month of little contact with anyone outside his immediate family. 
""The world has changed. It could easily have been very depressing and anxiety-inducing, but even in self- quarantine we were connected through the mobile web,"" said Koo, who is 54 and identifies as a product of a pre-digital world. ""We were cut off but not cut off at the same time, connected all the more intimately."" 
Koo, though, said he believed there were things that would never be replaced with an app or a screen. 
""There is an emptiness that comes from not being able to see someone's facial expression, feel their warmth and share a moment of kinship,"" he said.

Two weeks into self-isolation in her spacious Berlin apartment, Julia Schössler has learned a few new things about herself and discovered that some things probably won't ever change-even when life eventually reverts back to some kind of normal. 
""I've always hated working from home,"" says Ms. Schössler, a 47-year-old manager of Schoesslers, the PR agency she founded. ""I can't wait to go back to the office.""

Like most countries hit by wave after wave of coronavirus infections, Germany has effectively locked down. nonessential workers, and millions of people are either working from makeshift offices at home or are now stuck at home wondering if they will still have a job when the crisis is over. 
In addition to the challenges of running her business from home, adapting to the new rules of digital collaboration and networking, Ms. Schössler says the ""invisible enemy"" and the uncertainty of when and how much of her old life will return has an impact that is deeper than just shifting logistics. 
""Psychologically, it's a burden,"" she says. ""I realize that I really need people around me. I work best in a 
team."" 
She's not entirely alone. Ms. Schössler shares a large three-room apartment with tall glass windows overlooking central Berlin with her dog, Buffy, a 9-year-old German shepherd, who provides companionship and ensures that Ms. Schössler leaves the apartment for walks and gets her mind off 
work. 
""Without Buffy I'd get caught up in my job a lot more,"" she says. ""The dog gives me a reason to go out, he helps me escape the monotony."" 
Like many independent businesses during the shutdown, Schoesslers has lost some accounts as clients cancel discretionary spending to cut costs. Marketing budgets are usually among the first to get hit during any economic downturn. 
But with so many people now working from home and trying to maintain their businesses online, Ms. Schössler says she is also acquiring some new clients who are looking for advice on how to communicate during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Schoesslers is also working pro bono on a campaign called ""Long Live The Block,"" an effort to get people to buy vouchers and gift certificates from their local businesses-restaurants, bars and beauty salons- to provide them with cash to get through the crisis. 
Ms. Schössler continues to interact with her staff online, who have moved regular team lunches or after- work drinks onto Zoom or other digital conference rooms. 
There has been one huge change in Ms. Schössler's life. A serial networker, before coronavirus Ms. Schössler rarely ate at home. 
""Now, I'm forced to cook,"" she says. ""The first endeavors were a bit disappointing, but it's also been fun, even if I'm not a super chef and I haven't bought any cookbooks like some of my friends."" She mostly experiments with pasta dishes and different salads, but the longer she's stuck at home, the more she thinks about experimenting with new dishes. 
Ms. Schössler acknowledges that her isolation isn't suffering, it isn't existential. There are many people who are living precariously and are hit harder. But the abrupt shutdown was initially a shock that will likely leave lasting change.

43,Cystic Fibrosis Intensifies Pandemic for 33-Year-Old Australian; Jonathan Despinidic is mentally preparing to stay in isolation for six months; 'I'm trying to suppress the anxiety and not worry about it.',"This article is part of "" Life in Quarantine,"" a global look at the human condition in the age of coronavirus. 
Jonathan Despinidic, 33, Sydney 
Profession: consultant and entrepreneur 
Household: two adults 
Greatest disappointment: finding out that some friends aren't taking social distancing seriously 
Greatest discovery: The ordeal has strengthened his relationship with his wife 
When 33-year-old Jonathan Despinidic got the regular flu a few years ago, it quickly progressed to pneumonia, and he had to be hospitalized for three weeks. That is because Mr. Despinidic, a consultant and entrepreneur in Sydney, Australia, suffers from cystic fibrosis-a genetic condition that impairs lung 
function. 
It isn't yet clear how exactly the coronavirus impacts people with cystic fibrosis, but Mr. Despinidic isn't taking any chances. He hasn't left the two-bedroom apartment he shares with his wife for nearly three weeks, aside from a jog, a walk, taking out the trash, and lounging on his building's roof. 
That attitude could save his life. Recent data show that half of people who died with cystic fibrosis were under 31, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 
When he was in the hospital, ""there were a couple of times when I thought, 'OK, this might be it,"" Mr. Despinidic said. Now, as the coronavirus spreads around the world, ""I'm trying to suppress the anxiety and not worry about it."" 
But even cocooned inside his apartment, daily household chores can be rife with risk. A friend left coins in Mr. Despinidic's mailbox so he could use the dryer in his building's laundry room. Afraid the virus might hitch a ride on the coins, Mr. Despinidic wiped them down with sanitizing wipes.

""Three weeks ago I was in a pub with a whole bunch of people and having work drinks,"" Mr. Despinidic said. ""Now I'm afraid to talk to someone through a doorway."""" 
Mr. Despinidic is using the time in isolation to study app development, which will be helpful for a startup he is pursuing. He built a new desk out of leftover shelving and a chest of drawers, because his wife is using his home office, and he's lifting weights and doing online exercise classes in his living room. 
He went for a jog outside early in his isolation period, but decided that was a mistake. More recently, he walked to a nearby park, but went home after seeing it was packed with people. 
""I very quickly realized that a lot of people weren't taking this very seriously, and there were just too many sweaty people jogging around,"" he said. ""It's better to be safe than sorry in this environment."" 
When people packed Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach in March, forcing authorities to close it down, Mr. Despinidic posted a picture of the crowded beach on his Facebook page with the words: ""The more fun you have, the more likely I am to die."" 
He's mentally preparing to stay in isolation for six months. For food, Mr. Despinidic managed to get a priority delivery from one of Australia's big grocery chains. But he's worried about how he will refill some of his medications, which include a gene-therapy drug, vitamin supplements, enzyme replacements and an inhaler. 
There are still little joys. He cleaned his balcony, where he and his wife drink wine and greet the neighbors across the alley. Cockatoos perch on the balcony's edge. 
But even when authorities lift bans on large gatherings, Mr. Despinidic isn't sure how eager he'll be to return to the pub. ""The fear is that there's still a whole heap of people that are carrying it that are asymptomatic,"" he said. ""I'll keep isolated for a bit longer just to make sure all the figures are quite low.""""",4/1/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6
44,Foster children feeling the pain of isolation,"Biological parents battling to regain custody of children in foster care could lose crucial bonding time and see reunification stymied as dependency courts nationwide cancel hearings and suspend face-to-face family visits over coronavirus concerns. 
It's a devastating blow for nursing mothers and parents of very young or developmentally delayed children whose communication ability is limited already. While advocates for birth and foster families alike say they understand the need for isolation, some fear the measure may cause irreparable damage. 
""It's going to have long-lasting consequences that are going to hurt children,"" said Candice Brower, regional counsel for Florida's 1st District Court of Appeals, comprising 32 counties in northern Florida and the Panhandle. ""That bonding time is the thing we're most worried about. You can't get it back."" 
The strength of a parent-child bond factors significantly into social workers' decision about whether - and when - to return custody to biological families. 
""Even if it's not the parents' fault they didn't bond (because of coronavirus-related restrictions), it will certainly affect reunification and possibly slow them down,"" Brower said. ""We're hoping it won't be used against them."" 
The visitation suspensions - issued in counties across Texas, Florida, Nebraska and Maine, among others - are temporary. Some courts stipulate that in-person visits may continue if all parties agree to proceed. 
Foster children can still communicate with their parents and siblings via phone or video chat, but that's little comfort to a mother like Wendy McKee, who has grown accustomed to seeing her daughter in person almost daily. 
Typically, a social worker transports McKee's 2-year-old to her apartment in Omaha, Nebraska, for several hours of supervised visitation. McKee can hug her, read her books, practice shapes and colors or watch animated series on YouTube. 
When virus-prevention efforts ramped up last week, McKee was notified that her visits would switch to virtual. Still, she said, she feels lucky. Her daughter's foster parents have made an effort to continue in- person contact when possible. 
""(Virtual) visitation is more like watching her play. The interaction is gone,"" McKee said. When they share screen time in person, ""she's in my lap, and I can just hold her and be her mom. And you can't do that on video."" 
Struggle to stay in contact 
Many foster parents aren't able to make such concessions. 
National Foster Parent Association executive director Irene Clements said her organization has been fielding calls from foster families around the country who fear exposing their households to infection. 
""Let's say one of the kids in the home is immunodeficient in some way - they have asthma or are diabetic. A lot of kids in foster care do have extenuating health situations,"" said Clements, who adopted four children from the child welfare system and fostered many more. 
""Foster parents have a responsibility to all the children in their family, not just the one who happens to have a visit this week. How do you comply with that and keep everyone else safe?"" 
In Florida, Foster and Adoptive Parent Association president Amanda Cruce is encouraging all child welfare agencies to move to electronic visitation, but acknowledges the resulting emotional impact on parents who long to hold and hug their kids. 
She advises that foster parents be understanding and extra communicative: Text parents photos of their kids throughout the day. Allow FaceTime calls at more frequent intervals. Be flexible about call length. 
""A lot of it is about sharing the power, not being in control,"" Cruce said, noting that she's grown closer to her foster child's birth mother because she took time to explain the risks of continued personal contact and listened to the woman's input. 
In some parts of the country, logistical issues add further complications. 
In Ohio, a large portion of foster children are from rural areas, and about 25% of the 16,000-plus children in state care are placed with relatives who often lack the resources and support afforded to traditional foster families, according to Ohio Family Care Association administrator Dot Erickson-Anderson. Those homes may not have internet access or video-enabled devices. 
And some foster parents have expressed fears for their children's future that extend beyond connectivity. More than a quarter of parents with child welfare cases were referred because of substance misuse, Erickson-Anderson said, and foster families worry the stress of the coronavirus crisis could push parents 
back into old habits. 
Keeping hope alive 
It's too early to measure the coronavirus' true impact on the child welfare system. The longer the limitations on human contact last, the greater the consequences will be, advocates say. 
At Children's Network of Southwest Florida, a nonprofit that contracts with the Florida Department of Children and Families to provide child welfare services in the Fort Myers area, CEO Nadereh Salim says helping parents stay positive is a priority. 
""For some parents, their fragility comes from losing hope and giving up. (They think), 'Why should I continue to stay sober?"" Salim said. ""It's important to help biological parents not lose hope. Encourage them to keep going we're on track, it's not doom and gloom."" 
― 
Reuniting families is of ""foremost importance,"" she said, noting that her agency is looking at cases that are close to completion and making an effort to expedite the process. 
Children need additional reassurance during this time, too, and that support can come not only from their birth or foster parents but from siblings. 
Maria Batista entered the foster care system when she was 9 and counted on communication with her older brother to comfort her during their separation. She's now 24 and serving as membership chair for Florida Youth SHINE, a youth-run advocacy group. 
Foster care is ""such a weird time, and you always feel like it's your fault. Not seeing your siblings makes it even harder for kids,"" Batista said. She hopes caregivers will ""find creative ways to keep that bond and communication going because when it's lost, it's very hard to get that relationship back."" 
The disruption in daily routines is disorienting for parents as well, said McKee, the Nebraska mother. She reflects on the little moments she once overlooked, like watching her daughter sleep. 
""You don't know what you miss,"" she said, ""until it's gone.""",4/1/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
45,Easing the isolation with their quarantine buddies; Friends make pact -- no contact with others,"They call themselves the quarantine gang. 
They are not blood-related. They are not romantic partners. They are friends brought together by the unprecedented restrictions on face-to-face contact that have upended life across America to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
The foursome -- a songwriter, a therapist and two journalists -- has decided to be a family, of sorts, in a situation no one could have imagined a few months ago. They share meals, huddle together on the couch strumming guitars, exercise together, even hug. 
All four are single. The thought of weeks and potentially months alone was too much to bear. So they made a pact. They would see one another, and only one another. 
They are not the only ones creating impromptu families in the time of the coronavirus. People who live alone are especially tempted to acquire a quarantine buddy or two, for mutual aid as well as for human 
contact. 
Under stay-at-home orders from Los Angeles city and county officials, people should go out as little as possible, and group gatherings are forbidden. Quarantine buddy arrangements are sometimes met with stern disapproval from those who adhere to a traditional definition of family. 
Some public health experts emphasize the increased risk of contagion that comes with a larger social circle. Others say that forming self-contained units is an acceptable way to lessen the psychological 
stresses of solitude. 
In a city like Los Angeles, where people arrive from all over the world to make it in creative industries, friends often serve as surrogate families for those far from home. 
Laurie Penny, a television writer and journalist from England, shares her Silver Lake house with a roommate, songwriter Natti Vogel. Another member of the quarantine gang lives nearby, with the fourth in West Hollywood. 
""If I was by myself out here in L.A., so far from my family, I think I would have gone a bit bonkers,"" said Penny, 
33. 
Like many quarantine circles, this one has unwritten rules. Wear gloves when you press the crosswalk button. Keep at least six feet away from anyone outside the group. If you are thinking of doing something potentially risky, like a boxing workout with a friend, consult the others. 
The boxing was unanimously rejected, as was a request to host someone who needed a place to stay. Besides the quarantine gang, they refer to themselves as the pod, los quarantinos or fourcan (a play on toucan). 
The four had already been in close contact when stay-at-home orders came down from the governor and the mayor. All are musicians and had been filming a music video together. They had also been back and forth among one another's apartments after Penny and Vogel got bedbugs. 
Sam Braslow, a freelance journalist, considered three options: Move in with his parents and 92-year-old grandfather, isolate himself in his studio apartment or throw in his lot with his three friends. 
Staying with his biological family would have felt like regressing to childhood, with all-too-predictable annoyances ensuing. 
""If I had to choose who to go crazy with, I would rather do it with my more intentional family,"" said Braslow, 26. ""There's something novel about this. It's an adventure."" 
A small group of people does not have to be blood-related to safely practice social isolation, said Jeffrey Martin, an internist and professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at UC San Francisco. 
If members live in separate houses, they can reduce risk by having the same person always get groceries for the whole group and by receiving deliveries at only one address, he said. 
As the crisis wears on, if people are completely isolated, they could act out in ways more damaging than associating with the same few individuals, Martin said. 
""This is all about limiting the number of new contacts in your life, Martin said. ""Of those people who you contact, they are a product of all their contacts. If you can keep that circle small, it doesn't matter if you're 
related or not."" 
It is impossible for all Americans to lock themselves in a room for weeks, so people are figuring out their own boundaries, said Howard Forman, a professor of diagnostic radiology, public health and economics and management at Yale University. 
Over a long period of time, people will need some human contact, he said. He lives alone and has hung out with several friends in recent days -- from a distance of at least six feet, which he recommends for all quarantine buddies. He works as an emergency room radiologist and looks forward to the social interaction on his shifts. 
""It's certainly better to be in a room with someone than alone with Zoom constantly,"" said Forman, referring to the video communication service. ""I don't see that as conveying risk. But I don't get why they wouldn't want to maintain social distancing."" 
In an essay on the Medium website, an infectious disease epidemiologist cautioned about the extended transmission chains that can infect small family groups. 
""If 
your son visits his girlfriend, and you later sneak over for coffee with a neighbor, your neighbor is now connected to the infected office worker that your son's girlfriend's mother shook hands with,"" wrote Jonathan Smith, a doctoral candidate at Emory University and a lecturer at Yale University. 
Smith added that small indulgences, like ""one quick little get-together,"" could undermine the entire contagion-reducing framework. 
Yimu Xue, who lives in Pico-Robertson, chose her quarantine buddies carefully. One lives close by, and the two go on walks around the neighborhood. The other buddy comes over for wine and TV watching, bringing her own glass and sitting on the opposite end of the couch. Xue cleans her apartment before and 
after visits. 
Xue was already seeing these two friends regularly before the stay-at-home orders came down. She trusts them to go out only when necessary. Until the pandemic is over, she will not see anyone else, other than bringing groceries to her mother. 
Xue has been living by herself since her roommate decamped to be with family. Quarantine buddies are a coping mechanism, she said, along with reorganizing her house three times. 
""We're all trying to find a missing puzzle piece of our lives again,"" said Xue, 28, a freelance producer and creative director. ""This is a very infrequent light that we use to add a little bit of levity and add a little bit of what we miss about being social, because we are social creatures. I don't want to be scrolling on Instagram all day watching people."" 
There is plenty of levity in the apartments frequented by the quarantine gang foursome, which can take on the air of a ""young strangers thrown together"" reality show. 
Vogel, the songwriter, describes the group as ""well-read, gifted, currently dangerously sex-starved, deeply compassionate nut jobs. We are working round the clock to keep one another entertained, inspired, fed and 
virus-free."" 
They have read through plays, recorded songs together, performed for one another. 
Vogel led a concert from their front porch, with the audience social-distancing six feet away. As thanks, a neighbor dropped off milk and some squash. 
""It's like being theater kids again,"" Penny said. 
They message potential mates on dating apps, but it is impossible to meet in person. As the days wear on, they have discussed a no-hooking-up rule for the group. 
All are fortunate to still have paying jobs. 
Pam Shaffer, the therapist, is swamped with clients weighed down by coronavirus anxiety. On Zoom, she counsels them on how to deal with uncertainty, loss of control and grief about canceled plans. 
She is avoiding her parents, despite their pleas to come over, ordering groceries for them on Amazon instead. 
""I'm not going to your house because I love you,"" Shaffer, 38, said of her parents. 
Vogel is accepting commissions. He has written a coronavirus nursery rhyme -- ""We're grateful for our groceries/Corona, corona, we all bow down"" -- and a song about how to unplug from social media and find the energy within. 
The group is deciding whether to expand its ranks with another friend. Sometimes, the discussion veers toward a touchy subject: What is so important to you that you would choose it over the group and be cast 
out? 
Vogel's vulnerabilities are easily pinpointed by his friends: staying fit at the gym and recording at his musical collaborator's studio. 
""We need to care for each other,"" Vogel said. ""That's why we freak out as a group when someone talks about breaking quarantine.""

46,Self-isolation can be a portal to 'The Twilight Zone',"""The barrier of loneliness: the palpable, desperate need of the human animal to be with his fellow man. Up there... is an enemy known as isolation."" 
So goes creator and host Rod Serling's closing narration from the debut 1959 episode of ""The Twilight Zone,"" aptly titled ""Where Is Everybody?"" in which a man loses his grip when there is no human companionship to be found anywhere. 
Six decades later, ""The Twilight Zone"" can be found on multiple channels (including MeTV and Syfy) and streaming services (Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video), largely because its themes on the human condition ring eternal. Time travel, cosmic exploration, the power of new technology, the experiences that bedevil us, the nostalgia that summons us - so much of what fascinated Serling speaks to our sense of existential threats, including ways in which shortsighted behavior might hasten our own extinction. 
- 
As we live under self-quarantine or enforced lockdown during this covid-19 pandemic of more than 800,000 confirmed cases, some ""Twilight Zone"" stories are especially relevant. Or some episodes of the classic series - which CBS rebooted last year can be a diverting emotional escape. 
Here are seven of the most salient episodes to watch as we shelter from what lies outside our door: 
1. 'Time Enough at Last' 
One person's mass-casualty event is another person's opportunity to finally get a little reading done. Burgess Meredith plays the clerk who hides in his bank's vault to enjoy a few page-turners. When that girded vault allows him to survive a nuclear attack, the clerk is left gloriously alone - just himself and 
stacks of books to happily devour. The twist, of course, is to watch his step - isolation isn't all it's cracked up to be. 
(If you like this episode, also consider: ""Static."") 
2. 'The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street' 
Do humans help or harm each other in times of crisis? Serling's Maple Street is first presented as a benign slice of American society, but suspicion that an alien is among these neighbors sparks fearful finger- pointing, and conflicts escalate. When panic sets in, the monsters, of course, can be ourselves. ""There are weapons,"" Serling says in voice-over, ""that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices."" 
(If you like this episode, also consider: ""Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?"") 
3. 'The Lonely' 
How close do we grow to our devices in times of isolation? Imagine, if you will, a convict played by Jack Warden serving his solitary confinement truly alone on a sandy asteroid. Once his penalty appears to be a life sentence, the desperate prisoner is given a ""female"" robot that he develops feelings for. An intervention is required to remind him that he has come to love a companion made of only nuts and bolts. Sometimes, it seems, the illusory warmth of our machines must be destroyed. 
(If you like this episode, also consider: ""I Sing the Body Electric."") 
4. 'The Mind and the Matter' 
Jean-Paul Sartre said that ""hell is other people,"" and the office worker (Shelley Berman) in this episode would agree. He can't stand all the crowding, whether it's along the subway commute or in the lunchtime cafeteria. Yet when he lives his dream to eliminate all people, the loneliness makes for an awfully empty life. Serling's question is clear. Are we really meant to spend so much time alone? 
(If you like this episode, also consider. ""Sounds and Silences."") 
5. 'The Shelter' 
What will cause even the best of friends and spouses to turn on each other? In this story by Lamont Johnson, dear old pals gather for a birthday party, but a UFO sighting and talk of a possible nuclear attack drive a psychological wedge between the cozy neighbors. A doctor, for so long a healer, must weigh the prospect of loved ones perishing outside his bomb shelter. What is harder when self-preservation is at stake: 
a reinforced shelter door or the human heart?

As global leaders play politics, what becomes of a man who must tell the truth? In this episode, a used-car salesman (Jack Carson) suddenly loses his ability to traffic in lies. But, like a clever politician, the salesman can still bend the facts to his favor in this Cold War tale, which delivers a humorous twist when 
a rival nation is interested in a ""haunted"" auto.

47,"Castaways and Other Lonely Survivors; From prisoners to exiles to marooned sailors, human beings have faced the ordeal of enforced solitude.","Being one's own company can be blissful, but not when it's involuntary. According to John Donne, the 17th-century English poet and priest, ""As sickness is the greatest misery, so the greatest misery of sickness is solitude."" Now that nearly two in three Americans are currently subject to shelter-in-place orders as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, how will we cope with prolonged isolation? 
The Germans have a special word for feeling utterly alone and isolated: mutterseelenallein, a compound that literally means ""mother's souls alone."" According to one theory, the word entered the German language as a misinterpretation of the French phrase moi teut seul (""me all alone""), which was used by the Huguenots-French Protestants who fled to Berlin in the 18th century to escape persecution at home. 
Although the ancients didn't have an equivalent word, they certainly knew the feeling. In 44 B.C., the Roman statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero was declared an enemy of the state and forced into hiding. Despite his loneliness, or perhaps because of it, Cicero used the time to write his final work, ""On Duties,"" in only four weeks. 
We can't all be like Cicero, of course, and write a masterpiece while on lockdown. But we can certainly rise to the occasion and surprise ourselves. One of the least likely castaways in history was the wealthy French aristocrat Marguerite de La Rocque de Roberval, who in 1542 agreed to accompany her spendthrift cousin Jean-Francois de Roberval on a voyage to New France, modern Canada. The jolly adventure became a nightmare after Roberval accused Marguerite of sexual immorality while on board his ship. This was his flimsy excuse for marooning her along with her maid and lover on the deserted Isle of Demons off Newfoundland. 
Marguerite's lover and their baby soon succumbed, as did her maid, leaving the hitherto pampered heiress to survive in the wilderness as best she could. During her two years as a castaway she killed a bear, ate its carcass and turned its skin into clothing. After her rescue and return to France in 1544, Marguerite created a new life for herself as an educator. The treacherous Roberval escaped punishment, but was subsequently murdered by a mob in 1560. 
Such stories provided ample material to Daniel Defoe, who wrote the ultimate social isolation story, ""Robinson Crusoe,"" in 1719. The novel has been adapted many times since, including for the 2000 film ""Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks as the Crusoe figure. Defoe based his tale in part on the real-life castaway Alexander Selkirk, a Royal Navy officer who in 1704 was abandoned by his shipmates on a deserted island in the south Pacific, where he managed to survive until he was rescued five years later. 
Defoe himself knew something about prolonged isolation: In 1703, he was imprisoned for several months after he published a pamphlet satirizing the Church of England. Defoe's stint in prison made him a better advocate for the social outcasts he described in his novels, just as Crusoe's 28-year sojourn on the island made him into a better person-a man of faith and purpose rather than the malcontent of his former life.

51,"Single Life and the Coronavirus; For those living alone, lockdowns can amplify feelings of isolation. 'It's different now because it's imposed.'","Robert Jones felt ""trashed"" the morning after a recent night of dancing and drinking in his loft apartment. 
""I was like, 'Oh my God, I partied by myself and passed out on my own bed,"" the 47-year-old Miami-based realtor and musician said. Mr. Jones, who lives alone, had joined thousands of others cooped up social distancing in their homes who had logged into a virtual dance party hosted by the popular DJ D-Nice. 
Attending the party was one of the ways Mr. Jones kept himself engaged since he can't go out to socialize, and there is no one else home. To keep boredom, which can lead to lonely feelings, at bay, Mr. Jones plays videogames on his recently purchased Xbox, works on music, tidies his apartment, reads books, works out at his building's gym, indulges in two-hour phone calls with friends, posts on social media and makes regular trips outdoors to safely drop off care packages to homeless people. 
""We all have to pitch in on this dire situation,"" he said. ""It also gives me pleasure and something to add to my schedule."" 
Mr. Jones lives alone. So do more than 34 million other Americans, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates based on 2018 figures. And while many of them enjoy living on their own, the coronavirus pandemic is testing the fortitude of singles. 
Over the past decade or so, these adults got encouragement from articles, books, TED talks, seminars and podcasts that reframed solo living as positive and empowering rather than isolating and sad. Social- distancing guidelines challenge singles' come-and-go-as-they-please lifestyle, forcing them to become more creative in keeping occupied. 
""It's different now because it's imposed,"" said Bella DePaulo, author of the book ""Singled Out: How Singles Are Stereotyped, Stigmatized, and Ignored, and Still Live Happily Ever After."" ""For people who are single at heart, they often love having a place of their own, they look forward to their solitude. But now they don't have a choice about it, so that makes it a little less positive,"" she said. ""And then there's the uncertainty of not knowing how long it's going to go on.""

The isolation could be more challenging for people ""who were never very comfortable with their singleness,"" added Dr. DePaulo, an academic affiliate of the Psychological and Brain Sciences department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has been studying single people for more than two decades. While unapologetic solo-living adults might scoff at the idea that they should be felt sorry for and checked up on during crises, others ""may be very grateful to have other people thinking of them and reaching out to them,"" she said. 
""It's cheesy, I know, but every time a friend or family member reaches out, or my almost 5-year-old niece FaceTimes me, that's God's physical reminder that I'm still thought of and that I'm still loved,"" said Amy Mosher, who is single and lives alone in Cohoes, N.Y. 
The 38-year-old, who works in the business office of her city's school district, misses hanging out with friends, so they conduct virtual happy hours on Zoom. She also uses Zoom to join her weekly Bible study group, and she participates in a Facebook group for single Christians over 30. But she admits yearning for another human's touch after weeks of isolation. She recently burst into tears when a fellow church volunteer helping hand out meals offered her an air hug from afar. In her spare time, she has gone for runs, watched rom-com movies and read Nora Roberts books. 
""It's not all roses and sunshine as a single person, but it's not all woe is me, either,"" she said. 
""I sometimes feel bad that other people feel bad for me because I live alone and choose not to date, and I'm like, 'It's OK. I'm happy this way,"" said Melissa Jensen, 37, of Elmhurst, III. To stay connected with others, Ms. Jensen, who does in-store bakery training for a big-box store, her sister and their friends participate in a daily group chat on their phones, or she plays Uno on WhatsApp with friends. On her own, she reads, listens to podcasts, watches ""Judge Judy, vacuums her baseboards, sews and exercises to stave off boredom. She started including a toy clown in her activities. ""Instead of having a cat to talk to, I just talk to the clown,"" she said. 
Jacquleen Alagozian, a single 38-year-old in Los Angeles, fields calls from overwhelmed friends or cousins with children, spouses or partners. ""I don't have anyone at home frustrating me or causing any additional chaos in my life,"" she said. ""They tell me 'Jacquleen, you're so lucky!"" 
Ms. Alagozian, a marketing director for a nationwide lender, said as an introvert, adjusting to social distancing hasn't been too difficult. If anything, she said, it has allowed her to focus on things she didn't have enough time for before like running, eating healthier, cooking more and catching up with friends and family on the phone. 
""I am a super social butterfly, so I'm going crazy being trapped inside,"" said 28-year-old Brian Rice of Baltimore. His itch to be out is exacerbated by the fact that he had already spent six weeks at home alone recuperating from jaw surgery. Mr. Rice, a health inspector and Zumba teacher, said he is doing Zumba classes online, calling friends and family, playing videogames and watching TV to pass the time. ""I never actually just sat down and watched TV before,"" he said. ""I'm learning to be a little more introverted."" 
JT Kaufman, of Durham, N.C., loves living alone with her dog and two kittens in her first home, which she bought in August. Busy with work, hiking a lot and taking an online class on weekends kept the 30-year-old from focusing too much on coronavirus. But last week she had a vulnerable moment. ""I just finally caught up on how some of the numbers and projections were progressing and started to hear about more people who are young having it, and it really just took me aback,"" she said. ""I was hearing about people having trouble drawing breath, and I just kind of had an image of me being alone in my house, being in that situation, and just how terrifying that would feel."" 
Ms. Kaufman, whose family lives in Maryland, said financial worries also crept in. ""It's just starting to feel like this is just going to pull the rug from out under a bunch of people like me who started their adulthood in the recession and were just getting things on track,"" she said. And while she's not rethinking living alone, ""It's moments like this that kind of makes me think it would be great to have another human being just to exist through this weird unprecedented situation."" 
Getting Through Social Distancing While Living Alone 
Be prepared: Set up a contact list or make sure emergency contacts are updated, especially as your doctor is likely working remotely and your pharmacy might have different hours or practices in place. ""I do know people who are single and live alone and have serious health issues and they have set up some sort of arrangement,"" said Dr. DePaulo. ""Some of them email each other every day to make sure they're OK. They even have, I know it gets mocked all the time, but they might have one of those medical-alert buttons."" 
Structure your time: ""It's a lot easier to dwell on the negative when we don't have a good routine for ourselves,"" said Jennifer Taitz, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA and author of ""How to Be Single and Happy: Science-Based Strategies for Keeping Your Sanity While Looking for a Soul Mate."" Everyone needs to include something everyday that gives them pleasure, like watching ""Sex and the City"" reruns, listening to music on Spotify or lighting a scented candle. ""You also need accomplishments, like if you have some good books, or you went for a good run. We need both pleasure and mastery. It could be work projects like trying to take a class, or picking up an instrument if there's one sitting in your apartment that's been untouched."" 
Reach out: Call a family member or friend, just to touch base or when you're feeling anxious or melancholy. ""Reach out to a family member by phone rather than a quick text message,"" said Dr. Taitz. Also connect with friends and family members virtually through channels like FaceTime and Zoom. She also recommends giving to others. ""Do something nice for someone else, like pick up groceries for someone who's older,"" she said. 
Maintain perspective: Friends and family in marriages, relationships or with roommates might look good on the outside, but you never know. ""Just because you're single doesn't mean you're more subject to loneliness,"" said Dr. Taitz. ""You can also be in a relationship or be around other people and still feel lonely."" 
Dr. DePaulo added, ""I noticed the blog posts of couples who are getting really antsy and really annoyed with each other and all the quirks that seemed endearing once are now annoying."" That is not counting ""the more serious stuff that can go wrong in relationships, Dr. DePaulo said. 
Treat yourself: ""Actually treat yourself the way a romantic partner would,"" said Dr. Taitz. ""Really sit down at the table-don't eat standing up. Especially if you made something delicious that took you hours."" 
Take a breath: Yes, these are scary times. You're allowed to be afraid or worried, but don't let fear consume you. ""You can have that moment and then come back to anchoring yourself in the present,"" said Dr. Taitz. Meditation and focusing on appreciating what you have can help at a time like this, she said. ""You want to be a good friend to yourself. A lot of the things we worry about don't actually happen and will just make [feelings of] loneliness skyrocket.""",4/5/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,11,3
53,Ex-inmate says prison readied him for isolation,"Staying home' has dual meaning amid pandemic, after 24 years locked up 
Derrick Redd left prison on March 23 after over two decades behind bars. Until recently, he thought he would be there for two decades more. 
Instead, he walked out into a ""beautiful"" rain - and a pandemic. 
Many longtime prisoners struggle to adjust to modern society after release. But for a pandemic, prison primed Redd well. 
""I was ready. I was ready physically and mentally for this,"" said Redd, who was convicted in 1997 of holding up three banks in Prince William County and attempting to rob a fourth. ""Being locked down, that's just quarantine right there. Being in one place, one store, one laundry, one kitchen, one gym. That prepared me for what's going on right now."" 
Living with his elderly mother and stepfather in his hometown of Philadelphia, he is taking no chances. Anyone coming into the Mount Airy ranch house decontaminates in the basement first. Redd is aggressive with the Lysol wipes. He's already used to wearing gloves and a mask from working in the prison laundry. He does not mind spending a lot of time at home. He is excited just to clean his mother's bathrooms, not the way most people clean the bathroom - ""really getting in the corners and everything.” 
People want to come by for hugs and handshakes; instead he sticks his head out just to prove that, yes, after more than two decades in prison, he is really there. 
""A lot of people don't believe I'm home,"" said Redd, joking that he ""almost had to call the police to get the paparazzi out of the driveway!"" 
He made an exception for his daughter, now 30. 
""We had to hug - that's my only child,"" he said. He has also embraced his brothers and sister. When they stopped by his older brother's home on his way back from the prison, he hid in his mother's car so he could surprise his sibling and had to convince him he wasn't a ""hologram."" His mother, he said, will come into his room to touch him in his sleep, amazed he is really there. 
""But the rest of the people, we stay at six feet,"" he said. 
Having followed news of the coronavirus crisis from prison, Redd feels incredibly lucky. At Fairton prison in New Jersey, groups are no longer allowed to congregate for meals or recreation. Older inmates are terrified. 
""Everybody was trying to figure out how to get out,"" he said. ""A lot of guys in there are really scared because they can't... two, five years left feels really long now."""" 
He can't visit the friends he still has behind bars. 
Though his movements are restricted, there are still new things to experience. Like many Americans, Redd is discovering the wonder of video chat. 
""When I left, I couldn't see nobody on the phone,"" Redd said. ""When I come back, I can see six people on one phone. I didn't know what to say - I was looking at all of them."" 
He cannot meet with his probation officer, but he reached out by phone and sent a photo of himself. 
""I told him I'm serious about staying home"" - a phrase that now carries more than one meaning. It could be months before Redd starts the job that has been waiting for him for years, at a security firm run by his high school friend, Roger Leysath. Or before he explores the new buildings that have cropped up all over his city, so many he wonders whether he should take a bus tour. 
""I want to pick up Derrick and just take him for a ride in the city, Leysath said. ""I just wanted to show him the changes in the landscape of the city. Regentrification, new construction. But you're not supposed to go 
out."" 
Everything is closed. And, Roger said, his wife reminded him that it might be a good thing ""not to give him too much, too fast."" 
Leysath has spoken to Redd on the phone, and his old friend seems upbeat. But he wants to see him in person, to talk about how much they have both changed in the past 24 years. When Redd went to prison, Leysath was just coming out of his own drug addiction. 
""The eyes are the witness to the soul,"" he said. ""I want to remind him, before your fall, you were on your way to doing certain things. He's at a new beginning, a new threshold."" 
Redd was once a promising basketball player. He went to Philadelphia's Kutztown University on an athletic scholarship and was trying out for the National Basketball Association. A knee injury that summer destroyed those plans. A move to Northern Virginia did not help. Court records describe a history of alcoholism, drugs and petty crimes, ending in a string of armed bank robberies around his then-home of Lake Ridge. Three of those four crimes happened within 45 minutes of one another. They netted him $5,500 and 50 mandatory years in prison. 
For two decades, Redd repeatedly appealed that sentence and was repeatedly denied. His only winning argument was that he was too poor to pay fees for all of his other losses. He made his way down from Leavenworth in Kansas (""a gladiator outlet"") to Hazelton in West Virginia (""rough"") to Fairton, where his family was only 45 minutes away and for the first time he was treated ""like a human being."" 
In 2013, during one of his thrice-weekly trips to the prison library, Redd came across something unusual, even unprecedented. A federal judge in New York had persuaded a prosecutor to cut down a 57-year mandatory sentence. 
Like Redd, Francois Holloway had rejected a plea deal and been convicted at trial of multiple armed robberies. But at the judge's urging, U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch agreed to withdraw two of Holloway's gun convictions and release him three decades early. 
""Cases like Holloway's produce sentences that would be laughable if only there weren't real people on the receiving end of them,"" Judge John Gleeson wrote in his opinion. ""Even people who are indisputably guilty of violent crimes deserve justice."" 
Redd wrote to Gleeson to thank him for his decision. He wasn't the only one. 
""Word travels fast in prison, Gleeson said. He described the people serving these ""bone-crushing"" gun sentences as ""the high-hanging fruit of sentencing reform"" - left out of efforts aimed at helping nonviolent offenders. 
But the First Step Act of 2018 offered them a chance to campaign directly to judges for relief. Gleeson, who had stepped down in 2016, became not just an inspiration, but an attorney for Redd and many like him. 
""One would also hope that the covid-19 problem might induce judges to act sooner rather than later,"" Gleeson said. ""May as well do it before these guys fall victim to the dissemination of the virus in the 
institutions."" 
The Justice Department argued that despite changes in the law, a lengthy sentence that would not be imposed today is not ""extraordinary and compelling"" enough to justify release of prisoners who got those punishments decades earlier. 
""If that's all it takes for him to get compassionate release, then that truly would open up the floodgates,"" a prosecutor in Alexandria federal court argued last fall at a hearing in Redd's case. 
""If that opens the floodgates, so what?"" Gleeson responded. ""There's no such thing as too much justice."" 
Judge Anthony J. Trenga agreed, and last month ordered Redd's release. 
Redd is now 64. After years of prison food, he is ""trying to get my high school body back."" He spent two days drinking nothing but juice. Now he's eating a lot of shrimp and vegetables. He wants to cook for his family, but they won't stop cooking for him. His mother, Edith Brown, wants him to help less and rest a little more. 
""He's a good child,"" Brown said, before catching herself: ""But he's no longer a child."" 
Then she changed her mind. To her, he's still ""quite a young man."" 
""He's a good child,"" she repeated. ""Yes, he is."" 
And what advice does Redd have, having left confinement by law for confinement by public health 
mandate? 
""Stay in the house,"" he said. ""Listen to the CDC.""",4/5/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,neither,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
55,A Hostage's Guide to Isolation; What I learned about survival as a Taliban prisoner.,"I spent 45 days in Pakistan as a hostage of the Taliban in 2008. A college friend recently sent a note asking if I had any suggestions as to how people can physically and mentally cope with their coronavirus- induced confinement. Here's what I told him: 
Be calm. Try not to be afraid. 
Set a regimen. Get up early. Use that time to pray, meditate or exercise. 
Don't eat too much. It will make you listless. Try not to sleep during the day. It's a form of escape. Don't live in the dark. Natural light is best. We lived in darkness. I was always seeking the light. 
Keep your mind active and, as best you can, positive. Read only good books. I know one hostage who read the Quran. He isn't religious but it comforted him. I studied Pashtu in the afternoons for maybe an hour with my main jailer. It made my brain work hard and I felt good afterward, and it gave him power and made him feel good and smart and it brought him closer to me, I felt, bettering my chances to stay alive. 
In captivity everything becomes primal. A hierarchy develops. You become territorial, no matter how small your corner. The same, I believe, would happen in a home, even in a loving family. Don't seek power; give it to others if necessary. Be humble. Seek to get along with everyone, because everyone is afraid, and when people are afraid they can become irrational. If you can't go to the store and there's not enough food, give some of yours to others. It will draw you closer, and you will feel strong. 
Try to accomplish something: reading part of a book, learning new words, even of a foreign language, doing more push-ups, playing the piano, whatever it is, every day. Write letters. They are more intimate than emails, and you'll feel good. I know of a hostage who wrote a letter to his parents before he died. We all 
have two lives, he wrote. The second one begins when you realize that you only have one. 
Help one another and you will find warmth. I know of a hostage who became the leader in a large cell of men from different counties, because he helped others, in part by quiet strength. 
Keep a journal. It helps you free yourself and become relaxed. It is a form of therapy. You will find that you are stronger than you think. Shakespeare wrote that ""there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."" Try to think like this. 
Stay away from the computer as much as you can. I liked being away from the tyranny of emails. It gave me a sense of freedom. 
John McCain said there were no atheists in the Hanoi Hilton. They found comfort in prayer. So did I, and others. It gave us strength. I know a hostage, who, in the midst of a hard moment, forgave his captors. ""I had no choice,"" he said. He knew that if didn't, he would suffer in deeper ways. 
I know another hostage who wanted mainly to talk about mock executions. It was the fear of pain that bothered him most. Above all, don't be afraid. It will help you stay healthy. 
In the end you will be closer than before. You will become stronger for having gone through this, and it will make you feel quietly proud and, most important, grateful.

57,"How Rituals and Focus Can Turn Isolation Into a Time for Growth; As the author learned caring for his ailing wife, a well-ordered day with close attention to mundane tasks can let us endure with purpose","These harrowing times are taking an emotional toll, even on those of us lucky enough to be hunkering down in our own homes. Our new reality-disrupted lives, fears of infection, worries about loved ones, the loneliness that can come with prolonged isolation-brings to the surface disorganizing feelings, from panic to despair, that a busy life might keep at bay. But there are ways to make this period of self- quarantine not only endurable but rewarding. 
William James, the great philosopher and psychologist, observed that people are collections of habits but that we can rid ourselves of those that don't serve us well. He counseled us not to ""sit all day in a moping posture, sigh and reply to everything with a dismal voice."" New habits can carry us ahead in an organized way, letting us heighten our sense of control over our days and nights and keep disabling feelings in check. We can focus more on the small moments that comprise our lives, becoming more present and endowing ordinary routine with deep emotional investment. 
I had the opportunity-which, at the time, felt like a horrendous misfortune-to put that wisdom to the test as the primary family caregiver during my wife Joan's 10-year struggle with Alzheimer's disease. The long decline brought by a neurodegenerative disease creates a kind of slow-motion calamity. Life loses rhythm, direction, definition. 
Joan and I banished the feeling that we had fallen into limbo by reconstructing our daily activities. By celebrating shared experiences and intensifying attention to mundane tasks, we filled those moments with passion and awareness. Exercise, cooking, eating, reading, work and even watching the news became 
more deliberate components of our daily ritual, giving us happy moments to look forward to, creating a mood of anticipation rather than paralysis. In a time of randomness and uncertainty, it made us feel proactive instead of reactive. 
Joan is gone now. My job is no longer to care for her but to practice self-care. I am 79 and entering my fifth week of social separation. I am hale and healthy, although I have well-controlled asthma and hypertension. All this puts me in a high-risk category, making self-isolation a must. 
The wisdom that I acquired giving care to Joan helps me cope with the solitude. The threat of feeling vulnerable and defeated is ever-present, but I know that I can manage it by organizing my day around highly ritualized activities and giving myself over to them. 
I rise early and work out for two hours. After making breakfast, washing up and doing household chores, I sit down to write-both my regular academic work and now a diary of this new plague. I slow down for lunch, preparing a proper meal that I enjoy at leisure-a ritual | learned while caring for Joan. After lunch, I take a short walk and return to my academic work. I reserve the end of the day for my deepest pleasure, reading. 
In the evening, I catch up on chores, accompanied by the TV news-but I strictly limit how much I watch and read about the pandemic to only what seems most informative and personally useful. I prepare my dinner, which I again take time to enjoy. After a book, a movie or a TV show, I take myself off to bed, suffusing even washing up with an ordered, ritualized quality. 
I have also learned how important it is to be surrounded by whatever brings us joy. Music had been a great love of Joan's and mine-a source of comfort and sanctuary during her illness. Today, in isolation, I hardly ever feel alone: The sounds of aria and orchestra, violin and piano fill my empty house. 
The habits I developed during Joan's illness fundamentally changed me. They transform daily living into a chain of life-enhancing rituals that allow me to find and create joy, even when sheltering in place. 
We can all learn how to endure with purpose and make this a period of emotional and moral transformation. A plague, as Albert Camus knew, is the moment to ask what life is for. The response to Covid-19 suggests one answer: care for yourself and others. So take a breath and take the time to change the daily rituals that make up life. Throw yourself into them as if your life were at stake, which it 
is.

58,"Coronavirus Pandemic Takes Toll on Mental Health; Interrupted treatments, heightened anxiety and enforced isolation could cause lasting damage, especially to those with existing conditions","The battle to stop the coronavirus pandemic, fought with social distancing and enforced isolation, is taking a psychological toll that some officials warn could prompt another crisis, a mental-health one. 
Billions of people from the U.S. to Italy have been ordered to stay at home. Germany, Australia and the U.K. have determined that two people are a crowd and millions are cut off from family members, lovers and 
friends. 
Beyond acute stress and anxiety, psychologists say the confinement is beginning to trigger deeper troubles, including depression and compulsive disorders.

Helplines are running hot with callers in distress because of the pandemic. Surveys show people feel their mental health is worsening and governments and charities are inventing new ways to try to limit the psychological damage. 
""Psychologically, this is our 9/11,"" said Emilio Del Bono, mayor of Brescia, a northern Italian city at the heart of Europe's outbreak. ""In our individual and collective memories this disease has ripped us away from our dear ones and deeply marked our psyche."" 
Mr. Del Bono said the psychological toll on the town's population has been almost as bad as the sheer number of deaths-which exceeds 1,000-including on himself. 
In the U.S., Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit offering free support via text message, has seen traffic rise 40% over the past four weeks in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Some 78% of conversations that mention ""virus"" are about anxiety-including about getting sick, feeling lonely or worrying about financial hardship as a consequence of this pandemic, according to chief executive and founder Nancy Lublin. 
""The mental-health issues are an echo of the physical-health issues and the echo could even be worse,"" said Ms. Lublin, who says she needs more volunteers. 
Calls to Germany's biggest helpline have increased up to 20% in recent weeks and roughly 40% of them are about coronavirus, with people increasingly reporting loneliness and anxieties, said Petra Schimmel, member of the board of TelefonSeelsorge. 
Mental-health experts such as Simon Wessely, professor of psychiatry at King's College in London, say this may just be the beginning. ""There's no action without reaction,"" he said. ""It's going to be difficult for a lot of people."" 
A recent review for the Lancet medical journal of studies on the psychological impact during outbreaks of SARS and Ebola showed that quarantine can trigger issues such as emotional disturbance, depression, irritability, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger. Some of the studies suggested long-lasting effects. 
A survey of 52,730 people from across China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, conducted by psychiatrists from the Shanghai Mental Health Center between Jan. 31 and Feb. 10 on how the population coped during the Covid-19 outbreak found that almost 35% of respondents experienced psychological distress, women significantly more than men. 
""Sometimes the analogy is made with wartime. The difference with wartime is that people could still get together as communities and bond,"" said Dougal Sutherland, a clinical psychologist at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, which on March 25 began four weeks of national self-isolation. Now, he said, ""people's fight-or-flight response is activated, which can lead to people becoming distrusting of others. 
In Italy, people in need can call new hotlines or tap into a network of over 10,000 therapists for free video sessions, an initiative of Italy's national association of psychologists. David Lazzari, the head of the association, said he expects psychological emergencies to become a bigger problem the longer the situation lasts. The Lombardy region has been on lockdown since March 8, the rest of Italy since March 10. 
Other countries have taken similar initiatives. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last month more than 
6,000 mental-health professionals had volunteered to provide free mental-health service. 
The lockdowns, and the isolation that comes with it, can be even more trying for people with pre-existing 
mental-health conditions. Calls for increased hygiene can accentuate obsessive-compulsive disorders, someone suffering from depression could withdraw even further in the absence of routines, and an alcoholic could fall back into drinking without physical support-group meetings, psychiatrists warn. 
Thomas G., who declined to be identified with his last name, was in his fifth week of treatment for severe depression at a clinic in southern Germany when the coronavirus pandemic put an end to his therapy. His bed was needed to prepare for a surge in Covid-19 patients.

""It's understandable, but I feel like I'm being thrown into a pool full of sharks without yet having the strength to fight,"" said the 46-year-old IT manager who lives near Munich with his wife and children. He says he hasn't been able to find a therapist willing to take on a new patient before the end of the month. So far, he has been getting by, focusing on his family and jigsaw puzzles, ""but I don't know how much longer I can cope,"" he said. 
The psychiatric clinic of Berlin's Charité hospital tries to stay in touch with patients via phone or video calls, but that often isn't possible for older patients or the homeless, said Andreas Heinz, medical director and president of the German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics. 
How big a toll the pandemic will take on people's psyche will depend on the duration of the lockdowns, how deadly the virus becomes and the severity of its economic fallout, psychologists say. 
Mr. Wessely from King's College said he fears that the concentration of medical resources on the fight against coronavirus could prompt an increase in suicides as some serious cases of mental distress might go undetected.

60,"Even in a Pandemic, No One Should Have to Die Alone; Coronavirus isn't what killed my grandfather at 99, but it kept his loved ones from being there.","Near midnight on Sunday, my phone buzzed with a text. It was my mom. ""Grandpa is in heaven,"" she said. Fred Meyer, my beloved grandfather, was 99 years old and living in Florida, where he could be close to my uncle Jimmy, his devoted son, who cared for him with the help of other loving family members. But Jimmy wasn't allowed to be with grandpa as he died in the hospital. Precautions against the spread of coronavirus wouldn't allow it. My grandfather-husband to my beautiful grandmother Lillian, who had gone before him in death; father of five, grandfather of 13, great-grandfather of 12 thus far, friend to many more-died alone. 
It wasn't Covid-19 that took him. But the pandemic set the stage and shaped his final hours. A year earlier, grandpa had opted for assisted living so he wouldn't ""be a burden on anybody."" When it became clear that the virus was deadly for the elderly, the facility's management followed social-distancing best practices. Most employees were sent home. Grandpa was kept in his room. Food was left at his door. No visitors were allowed. Uncle Jimmy couldn't see him. 
Grandpa was found lying on the floor of his room. They rushed him to the hospital, where he died. No loving eyes looked on him in his final minutes, grateful for his life, commending him to God. We hope a caring nurse was at his bedside, but we may never know. 
At this time, in love for and solidarity with one another, we have been asked to keep apart. Without a vaccine or therapies, physical separation is our best weapon against the virus. The virus is particularly dangerous for the elderly and those with serious underlying health conditions. All this we know and strive 
to uphold. But there is a dark side to social distancing. Hours before my grandfather died, my mother relayed to me that her two friends in New York's Long Island were kept from seeing their 35-year-old daughter as she was dying of cancer in the hospital, alone. 
This is bitter, but there is no malice in it. It is a necessary precaution against asymptomatic carriers. 
But with rapid-testing abilities quickly expanding, how much longer will it be necessary? 
The virus is moving across America, and places once quiet will become hot spots. Cities and states across the country are preparing. As part of their broader preparations, hospitals should be poised to admit the family of mortally ill patients who can be proved by rapid test to be free of Covid-19. It will require creativity, 
but it can be done. 
If a patient uninfected by the coronavirus is dying and family wants to be bedside-if they aren't, in fact, a threat-letting them in is the humane thing to do. That, of course, has been imprudent to this point during the epidemic. But as the capacity to test increases, the moral calculus changes. We should not needlessly separate families when their loved ones are dying. The moment of death is a sacred time, and being present for it flows from our gut knowledge of the intrinsic value of the dying. We love them. They are human. They are our family. And they are leaving. 
If they are willing, healthy clergy who have taken necessary precautions-such as donning the proper protective gear- should be admitted to send off the dying with prayers and sacraments. If we continue to separate the dying from their families and pastors, we will transform an exigency into a cruelty. 
What of the elderly in nursing homes or assisted living? Is this the best we can do for them, to lock them away with no foreseeable end to the isolation? No, it isn't. States should allow such families to make one family member eligible for visits. That family member would be tested for the virus before each visit. This would be a massive undertaking, no doubt. But the alternative for many is loneliness unto death. 
In the coming days, my grandfather's remains will be flown from Florida to New York, where he will be buried in a family plot next to my grandmother and my uncle John, his son. Most of the family won't be permitted to attend because of local lockdowns and caps on the size of gatherings. This, too, will break our 
hearts. 
These are evil times. And that's why we must do everything in our power to leaven them with good. Rest in peace, grandpa. You were a family man, a patriot and a marvelous storyteller. We will love you forever.",4/10/20,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1
62,"Lessons in Constructive Solitude: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]","During most of his life Henry David Thoreau was, by conventional standards of success, a failure. He rarely left the farm town of Concord, Mass., where he was born in 1817. There he was viewed by at least some of his neighbors as a marginal figure, standoffish, politically radical, a loner, a crank. As a member of the New England literary world he cut a graceless figure and had an inauspicious professional start. 
His first book, ""A Week on the Concord and the Merrimack River,"" self-published in 1849, was a bust. He sold a mere fraction of its 1,000-copy press run. When the printer dumped the remainders on him, Thoreau stacked them up in his bedroom and wrote in his journal: ""I now have a library of nearly nine hundred volumes, over seven hundred of which I wrote myself."" 
His second book, ""Walden; or, Life in the Woods,"" based on his experience of living in a one-room cabin and in a state of rural semi-self-quarantine, found more readers. And, crucially, they were ardent ones. From the book's first appearance in 1854 his star began to rise. And within 10 years of his death in 1862, at 44, he was famous enough to be honored with a public monument. 
An odd monument it was: a loose pile of stones set on the site of the one-room cabin Thoreau built at 
Walden Pond. The pile, usually referred to as a cairn, seems to have begun as an improvisation. In the summer of 1872, the suffragist Mary Newbury Adams, a Thoreau fan, visited Concord and asked to be taken to Walden. Her guide was the utopian thinker Bronson Alcott, one of Thoreau's oldest friends. By this point, any physical trace of Thoreau was long gone and there was nothing to signal the site's significance. Adams wanted to change that. 
In his diary Alcott writes: ""Mrs. Adams suggests that visitors to Walden shall bring a small stone for Thoreau's monument and she begins the pile by laying stones on the site of his hermitage."" He too added a stone that day, as did members of a local church group who happened to be picnicking nearby. Word went out and the custom spread as, over the years, more pilgrims came. (I was one of them.) The heap of stones, most harvested from the pond's edge, is still growing (and shrinking; some people take stones away as souvenirs). Like many religious shrines, it's organic, in perpetual flux. 
There are many different Thoreaus to commemorate: the environmentalist, the abolitionist, the ethnologist, the globalist, the anti-imperialist, the Yankee saint who earned the devotion of Tolstoy and Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. But to me, as a visitor to Walden since childhood, the cairn means most as the marker of an event: Thoreau's two-year-plus experiment in self-isolation. It's a condition many of us are experiencing during the present pandemic moment. And we can learn a lot from what Thoreau created from it: constructive solitude. 
It's important to note that his isolation was not the sheltering-in-place kind. It was not enforced (unless you consider life-style decisions made by a driven personality and deeply principled thinker to be beyond free choice). And his apartness was far from total. He went into Concord several times a week to catch up on gossip and have dinner with his relatives. At Walden, he entertained guests and enjoyed regular chats with Irish laborers who worked on a railroad line close to the pond. 
At the same time, social distancing came naturally to him. He was, or could be, an irritable and thin-skinned guy, someone for whom the human species was a problem. (""I do not value any view of the universe into which man and institutions of man enter very largely, he wrote.) When he was in a misanthropic mood, six to eight feet of separation wasn't nearly enough. Try a mile and a half, which was the approximate distance from Walden to the center of town. 
But if the Walden cabin, about the size of a garden shed, was in some sense a retreat, a refuge from ""the noise of my contemporaries,"" it had many more positive functions: it was a studio, a laboratory, an observatory, and a watchtower. Reading ""Walden"" -- or, better, his more lucidly written journals -- as I have done these last weeks, we sense that Thoreau viewed the Walden outpost less as a defensive necessity than as a place of opportunity where he could do what he could not easily do in the everyday world: namely, concentrate, focus, which I've always suspected was a way for him to handle incipient anxiety and despondency. 
For one thing, he had that first book to write -- an account of a boat trip he had taken several years earlier with his older brother John. The book would be Thoreau's first attempt at the blend of field research, philosophy and autobiography that would become his signature mode. More important, the book would be a memorial to his beloved brother whose death from tetanus at 27 -- he had nicked himself while shaving -- 
shadowed Thoreau's life. 
—— 
He used his semi-seclusion at Walden, which began in July 1845 and ended in September 1847, to pursue an intensive course in self-education, one that required undistracted reading. ""Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written,"" he wrote. The list he compiled was long, ambitious and culturally far-reaching, stretching from Classical Greece to Vedic India. 
In a letter to a friend he wrote: ""The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, contributes in his degree to creation; he breathes a divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I am a yogi."" He made his time at Walden one of those intervals. 
(Interestingly, during the present lockdown, several of my friends have returned to a practice of meditation that their pre-pandemic lives had left little time for.) 
—— 
The education further entailed a total immersion in Nature in plants, in seasons, in stars, in all creatures four-legged, winged and scaled. For Thoreau, Nature was a communicating consciousness, and he wanted to make himself available to it, antennas raised. Full receptivity required removal from ego-driven clamor, which was how, in his most stressed moments, he viewed human discourse. 
Finally, he used his set-aside time at Walden to clarify his political thinking. For Thoreau, revolution began at home, one person at a time. ""We must first succeed alone,"" he wrote, ""that we may enjoy our success together."" It was while living at Walden that he spent a night in jail for refusing to pay taxes that he saw as contributing to a warmongering, slavery-supporting government. At Walden he wrote the lecture that he would later shape into the essay known as ""Civil Disobedience."" 
Thoreau left Walden in 1847 to take a job as a caretaker in the household of his off-and-on friend Ralph Waldo Emerson, who owned the land on which Thoreau had built his cabin. His departure was both sudden and logical. ""I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that one."" 
And he did have more lives, many; he once listed some of them: ""I am a Schoolmaster -- a Private Tutor, a Surveyor - a Gardener, a Farmer -- a Painter, I mean a House Painter, a Carpenter, a Mason, a Day-Laborer, a Pencil-Maker, a Writer, and sometimes a Poetaster."" And this makes no mention of the activist, the naturalist, 
the moral philosopher, the self-exile and the utopian-community-of-one -- that is, the Thoreau we care most about now. 
You might think of each stone on the Walden cairn as commemorating one of these identities or several intertwined. In his view, purposeful solitude and justice-minded community were codependent, the source of long-term social health. He knew what his view was up against: among other things, America's antsy addiction to distraction and its led-by-the-nose, corporation-fed faith in utopian technology. 
And the call for civil resistance - individual and collective -- that issued from his Walden shelter? It is still 
hot-to-the-touch. Thoreau was not a pacifist. He vehemently supported the armed raid led by the abolitionist John Brown at Harpers Ferry. When Brown was hanged, Thoreau delivered a furious public speech in Concord, standing under an upside-down United States flag. Surely the Civil War, underway when he died, came as no surprise. 
—— 
But the monument of stones at Walden is the opposite of angry, or declarative or, for that matter, monumental. It speaks of aloneness-within-solidarity -- a message we need to hear these days -- in a homely down-to-earth way, one that Thoreau, who scorned all pomp and eye-baiting elegance (he once described himself as a ""stuttering, blundering clod/hoper"") might have approved of. 
It's a monument designed by no one, built by everyone. It's assembled one piece at a time, over time, by individuals who will never meet, but who, in our devotion, form a community of souls. It's a monument that honors the dead, but is living, changing, growing. During the present crisis that is isolating us, this monument has the potential to bring us together: It is an instructive emblem to contemplate, and a consoling one.",4/10/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,only benefits,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,2,3
63,"For young caregivers, isolation and sacrifice are nothing new","Shelby Small was on track to finish college debt-free, travel, start a career in fashion and look for a life partner. Then, her father fell gravely ill. 
The following year, at age 23, Small put aside her studies and left her full-time job to help her mother care for her father, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in their Laurel home. 
Small's life telescoped inward. While her friends were living the college life and preparing for careers, she was focusing on monitoring her father's BiPAP machine (a device that helps him breathe) and changing his cannula (plastic tubing that delivers oxygen) in the daily struggle to keep him alive. 
""At first it was frustrating, because you're always told when you're in your 20s, and especially your early 20s, that this is when you're supposed to take advantage of what's offered,"" said Small, 27. ""You're supposed to be getting your life together."" 
Taking care of an ill or disabled family member at any age is taxing, psychologically, physically and financially. But caregivers in their 20s and 30s face additional challenges. Their careers are less likely to be established than those of middle-aged people. Among millennials who have jobs outside the home, one-third earn less than $30,000 per year. They are less likely than those in older groups to be married or to have 
reached other milestones of adulthood. 
Their lives are challenging, at best. The arrival of a virus that has a high fatality rate for people over 60 with underlying health conditions has made it even more so. 
When the coronavirus struck, Small said, she and her mother ""had to talk to my dad's in-home hospice workers about what precautions are in place to keep everyone healthy, since they see so many patients every day."" 
She knows social distancing and extreme hygiene may seem excessive to some, but when dealing with someone with a compromised immune system, it's necessary to keep them healthy. ""I have literally practiced these things for the past five-plus years,"" she said. 
An isolating experience 
- 
While most family caregivers are older - the average age in 2015 was 49 - nearly a quarter, or about 10 million people, are millennials, born between 1980 and 1996, according to AARP. 
And, unlike older caregivers, they have few peers who can relate. 
Small's life as a caregiver has been extremely isolating. ""When you try to talk to your friends about it, it's kind of awkward, because you're dealing with [a] parent transitioning into death. . . . Most people my age aren't necessarily dealing with that, and so people kind of get very quiet, or they basically just stop talking to you because they don't know how to relate to you."" 
She says she feels empathy for young people who are now getting a crash course in the disconnection she has experienced. Some have had to return home, away from their peers, their careers and the lives they had planned. 
Small had other plans, too. She had worked as an administrative assistant, but she often needed time away to care for her father. She believes her age made it harder for her employer to understand when she needed 
time off. 
""It was almost as if I was taking care of a relative with the flu instead of [being] someone who had a parent who was in the process of dying,"" she said. ""I would be in the middle of an appointment with his nurse, or I would be giving him his medication [when] they would literally email me . . . about things that I didn't think were really important, like address changes or 'What do you think of this layout for the website?' It was never 'How are you?' or 'I hope things are going well, which was hurtful, because I'd worked there since I 
was 19."" 
She never returned to her job. 
The pressure on younger caregivers is evidence that the old paradigms don't work anymore, said Josephine Kalipeni, director of policy at Caring Across Generations, an organization advocating for greater 
government support. 
""The caregiving situation that we're facing today was built on the presumption of a full-time, stay-at-home caregiver,"" she said. But millennials "" are having to cut back on work hours, drain their savings, move and give up promotions, all because you have to caregive."" 
Jennifer Levin, 39, started a Facebook group called Caregiver Collective after she began caring for her father in her early 30s. 
More than 500 members from around the world, most under 40, have joined the three-year-old group in search of community and practical advice. 
""A lot of people have really never admitted what they go through out loud,"" Levin said. 
Since the onset of the coronavirus, Levin said, a record number of members are attending the group's online video chat, looking to connect. Quarantine and self-isolation have placed some at home 24 hours a day with the person they care for. 
""There is no delineation of a private life at all, which was hard enough to balance before,"" she said. ""Others are trying to care for someone who does not live with them and figuring out how to manage caregiving without getting physically close to that person."" 
Still, members of the Facebook group, which Small belongs to, seem to have a more positive attitude than other caregivers, Levin said. 
""In other support groups, in person or online, when it's a lot of older people, there's a lot of bitching that goes on, and I've noticed in this group there's no negativity,"" she said. ""There's a feeling that this is hard, but there's no 'My life sucks.' . . . I wonder if it's a generational difference in how we process adversity"" 
Monica Moreno, senior director of care and support for the Alzheimer's Association, said this response is consistent with some of the character traits often used to define this generation. ""They're socially conscious they support causes they're passionate about. Caregiving can be viewed as a cause,"" she said in an email. ""They are interested in making a difference. They value work-life balance - this is a really important concept to embrace if you are going to have a good attitude about caregiving. They are compassionate."" 
Levin agreed, noting that another defining characteristic of millennials is their tendency to be closer with their parents than previous generations. ""We have a different relationship with our parents than older generations do, and I think there's a closeness where we feel more likely to step forward and say, 'I'll take care of my parents! We're not someone who left the house and said, 'See ya, I'm going to have my own life."" 
'I'm hoping that this exposes the flaws' 
Aisha Adkins of Dunwoody, Ga., never had the chance to move out of her parents' home. At 27, she had graduated from college and was looking into jobs and graduate schools when her 57-year-old mother was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. A paid caregiver was too expensive, and her mother was too young for Medicare. Because of her father's income, the family didn't qualify for Medicaid. His job came with health benefits, so Adkins stepped in. 
""I thought I was going to live the life, but yeah, things changed quickly,"" said Adkins, who is now 35 and has been caring for her mother for eight years. She cooks, cleans, does laundry, manages medication, schedules doctor's appointments, and helps her mother bathe, eat, dress and get in and out of bed. ""Even when I'm away from the house, I'm calling in to give medication reminders."" 
On paper, she knows she might look like a slacker. ""There's kind of a running joke about millennials living with their parents until they're 45,"" she said. ""It stings a little bit, because there's an assumption of laziness 
and lack of ambition associated with that."" 
Adkins doesn't know how long her role as a caregiver will continue or if she'll have to pick it up again with her father. And if it does end, she doesn't know how she will forge an independent life. 
Adkins is unfazed by the quarantine mentality now gripping the nation. ""I'm used to freaking out every time someone coughs or sneezes, so it's nothing new for me. What's interesting for me is to see the rest of the world morph into a similar mind-set."" 
She worries the pandemic will strain resources such as Medicaid and Social Security disability in the short term, but hopes it will eventually improve the lives of families like hers. 
""When people are exposed to food scarcity and sickness that we've never been exposed to before, it changes voters' minds, and it can change policymakers' minds,"" she said. ""We need paid medical leave and family leave. We need a better long-term support system and better long-term care. I'm hoping that this exposes the flaws that exist and we're able to make rapid changes in order to protect the most vulnerable population."" 
'I feel like I understand them' 
Despite the challenges, millennial caregivers say the experience is not all bad. Jeffery Kearney, 36, started taking care of his mother as a teenager in Pine Bluff, Ark., and picked a university close to them so he could race home when needed. Now a District resident, he still helps by coordinating doctor's appointments and speaking to hospital representatives. 
He's also representative of the change millennials are bringing to caregiving. Where two-thirds of caregivers in older generations are white, just 44 percent of millennial caregivers are, while 27 percent are Hispanic/Latino, 18 percent are African American and 8 percent are Asian American/Pacific Islander. Nearly half, 47 percent, are men, compared with 40 percent of caregivers overall, according to AARP. 
Because of the role that Kearney took on in his mother's care, he said, ""my mom and dad and I and brother are abnormally close. I imagine that having to take on those responsibilities added to the connectivity that we all shared.... I feel like I know them in a way many people don't know their parents. I feel like I understand them, have a clarity that many people don't have when they're young."" 
Natasha Small, Shelby's mother, said her daughter's help has been crucial, but she and her husband find it devastating to see her so sequestered at such a young age. 
""This is horrendous work, and ... it breaks my heart that this is the kind of harvest that she's reaping at this particular moment in her life. But I do believe it gives her a more mature perspective on her life,"" she said. 
It has also given Natasha a new perspective on her daughter. ""She said, 'It's my dad, these are his last days, I'm going to be here,"" Natasha said. ""I was really surprised at how strong she was, because she's still my baby... to just see how she's weathered through this and how she has really and truly become more like a friend.""",4/10/20,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3
65,Isolation amid pandemic can trigger mental health issues,"The invisible effects of our current coronavirus lockdown -- anxiety, fear, isolation -- have created an America in crisis. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey in early April found that 45% of adults said COVID-19 has negatively impacted their mental health. Another recent national survey of 3,300 young people, conducted by DoSomething.org, found that 89% of respondents said they are concerned about the coronavirus outbreak, with 34% very concerned. When asked how they feel about COVID-19, 54% are frustrated; 49.3% are nervous; 40% disconnected; 33% sad; 27.9% hopeful; 14% angry; and only 12.1% indifferent. 
These statistics present the tip of an iceberg of angst young people are feeling as they endure the constriction of their freedom and the stark realities of social distancing. And for youths of color, whose levels of anxiety and stress are often intolerably high already, the assault on their mental health is even more devastating. 
Communities United, a Chicago grassroots organization, partners with the National Association of Social Workers-Illinois and other mental health providers. CU's program helps disconnected young people of color heal from the emotional trauma of living amid poverty and violence by taking action on issues of inequity through advocacy and organizing. 
CU knows from its work that young people are especially vulnerable during this time of crisis. And we know that when young people take positive action, it empowers them. And empowerment is what helps to heal 
trauma. 
Take Derrianna Ford, 16, of West Ridge, the neighborhood with the most COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday. Buffeted by homelessness and family separation due to the criminal justice system, she was quiet and distant. But Derrianna has transformed herself into a dynamic leader through the CU process, called Healing Through Justice. Now she's advocating throughout Chicago and Illinois for young people's increased access to mental health services. 
""We are leading research and action to transform a mental health system so that it works better for us,"" she said. ""This work is more important than ever as we deal with the aftermath of being asked to stay home, where for some young people it is not the safest place to be."" Meanwhile ""many are faced with mounting pressures, such as wondering if their families will have enough to pay for rent and food."" 
Derrianna's story demonstrates the acute need for affordable housing and a social safety net for all Americans, especially those feeling the impact of inequity. 
We applaud Gov. J.B. Pritzker for his leadership in guiding the state through this crisis. Today we present a call to action that, if applied right now, can help thousands of youth who are at the margins get through this 
crisis. 
Here are three things Illinois can do immediately to help young people deal with the emotional challenges they are presented with during the pandemic: 
* Relax regulations on how school social workers and counselors can contact students, so students can get at-home help during this crisis from a virtual one-on-one and virtual group setting. 
* Allow school-based mental health professionals to see general population students, not just those with an individualized education plan. 
* Create an emergency mental health hotline for young people. 
* Designate an office to lead emergency mental health coordination for young people including people who are underinsured, uninsured or those who are unsure how to connect to services. 
With increasing anxiety and despair among youth, we are likely to see more of them thinking of suicide and engaging in high-risk behaviors including substance misuse and self-injurious behavior during this period of isolation. Many youth at highest risk of harm have not been identified as having mental health challenges, and lack of access to mental health assistance is widespread. It is crucial that we open this path toward empowerment to our disconnected youth. 
The time to act is now. To highlight this issue, Communities United and NASW-IL, in association with Voices of Youth in Chicago Education, held an online town hall Thursday with elected officials and members of the media. Virtually, young leaders expressed their concerns, challenges and recommendations in facing the COVID-19 crisis as part of our ongoing efforts to address trauma through action. 
The COVID-19 pandemic is shedding light on the importance of mental health right now and highlighting inequities based on race and class that we all must address. 
By making social solidarity important in our personal lives and by protecting our most vulnerable with governmental policies, we can lift up young people and families now during COVID-19 and tomorrow, when we can all go outside together and feel the sunshine again.",4/12/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2
69,Artists struggle to find inspiration in isolation,"There's this tired but persistent old trope about artists: that they thrive in isolation, that somehow they exist exempt from society, or immune to it. This antisocial distance, we suppose, grants them a view from on high, a clearer perspective on things. So when, say, a pandemic hits, we can't wait to see what they do with it, apart from survive. 
We've been romanticizing the value of me-time for artists for centuries - from the mountaintop musings of the Tang dynasty poet and hermit Hanshan to the novel stylings of the famously low-profile Thomas Pynchon, for whom my only visual reference remains his animated appearance on ""The Simpsons"" with a paper bag over his head. Some of the divine strangeness we assign to a poem by Emily Dickinson, or a canvas by Agnes Martin or a musical meditation by Arvo Pärt, we attribute to their creators' sublime 
detachment from the mundane. 
But this notion that isolation from society is the truest way for artists to ""suck out all the marrow of life,"" as Thoreau somewhat grossly put it, seems painfully anachronistic. We've never been more connected, more wired, more social-but-not. Gradual erosions of privacy have wiped out quaint old notions about ""private lives."" Today, the idea of an artist making a big show about being absent would seem as hammy and performative as an artist making a big show about being present. 
Much like everyone else, artists of all kinds are experiencing the uncertainties of the coronavirus and their place in society very deeply - albeit with some particular challenges: How to create amid such destruction? How to connect with audiences from complete isolation? And what to make of these times, not to mention all of this... time. I wanted to know how artists are dealing with our new condition of collective isolation - which, ironically enough, has made everyone easier to reach. 
The Berlin-based interdisciplinary artist Nina Katchadourian, 52, specializes in works that find a kind of majesty in the mundane, relying on overlooked materials and finding big ideas in curious details. (She's created an entire body of work from her seat on a plane - or its lavatory.) 
- 
""I'm a believer that there's a lot you can do with nothing,"" she tells me, ""but certainly, the circumstances have made me say, 'Okay, you've been saying this, what are you doing about it right now? How true does this turn 
out to be for me?"" "" 
On a day-to-day level, she's been trying to maintain connection by smiling and making eye contact with her fellow Berliners, even as she keeps her distance on the street (""It's not a very Berlin thing to do."") 
And while her practice as an artist usually benefits from her happy balance of extremes - she lives and works in New York and Berlin, but spends a portion of each year in a remote town in Finland - this new, compulsory isolation has altered the course of her creativity. 
""I have felt a familiar feeling the last couple weeks,"" she says, ""which is this really strong impulse to make things, but not things that I think of as art - things that I think of as stuff I want to give to other people. Like, gifts. I want to sew some dumb thing and mail it to my friend."" 
To satisfy this impulse she created Stickies Art School - or, rather, Stickies did. That's her cat. 
From his comfy-looking perch on the couch, Stickies has led a weekly series of drawing assignments for kids around the world. Voiced and virtually pupeteered by Katchadourian (and notably more grumpy), Stickies has inspired and critiqued dozens of drawings (of himself). He's also kept Katchadourian busy - she spent all week sewing and stamping 32 official Stickies Art School pillows to trade for the drawings. 
""Stickies Art School was this little project that I would not call an art project,"" she says. ""I just found it so relaxing to do this repetitive thing. I'm making something, but it's not this burdensome feeling of making art - of needing to have a point to make."" 
For Nolan Williams Jr., 51, a composer and one of the Kennedy Center's recent Social Impact Arts residents, keeping to himself and maintaining social distance hasn't been too big an adjustment. The hard part has been not having any way to share his artistry in person. 
""We move between those two spaces,"" he says, ""isolation and introspection on one side, and the sociality of needing to interact with other artists and wanting our work to be presented before audiences."" 
Williams was also hit hard by the sudden collapse of projects he's spent years fine-tuning. The virus threw two of his most ambitious projects into limbo: a touring production of his ""Stirring the Waters Across America, a musical exploration of the civil rights movement, was cut short after its opening performance in Nashville. And, after six years in development, his fourth musical, ""Grace,"" was called off as they were building the set for its March premiere at the 2020 Humana Festival of American Plays in Louisville. On the day ""Grace"" would have opened, Williams instead invited cast members to record their individual vocal parts from one of the play's central numbers, ""When Gran'Me Cooked."" He plans to release it online Sunday. 
""Walking back from the theater to the hotel that day [in Louisville] was probably one of the saddest, loneliest walks that I can actually remember,"" he says. ""And when I came back to D.C., for the first several days, in an uncharacteristic manner, I found myself binge-watching television shows like crazy and sleeping."" 
All isolation is not the same. When it's a choice made for you, you can only respond with choices of your 
own. 
""Even though this is imposed, Williams says, ""you can establish a level of normalcy for yourself. It's been a very slow and very intentional process of working through the melancholy that comes with the uncertainty. You've got to find in this new normal a place, and create space to be creative."" 
""I can't imagine what it would feel like to be a composer right now,"" says Sarah Darling, 40, a Boston-based violist and violinist who splits her time between musical eras and outfits as a member of Boston Baroque and the conductorless orchestra A Far Cry. 
During the first few weeks of the crisis, Darling and the other 15 members of A Far Cry had so many emergency meetings and family obligations to attend to, there was barely time to worry about the art part. Strangely, this flurry of activity at the outset of the pandemic felt familiar - reminiscent of the feast-or-famine nature of working in music. 
""Right now I'm feeling very grateful to be well-versed in those feelings,"" she says. ""In a way, this still feels normal, it feels like a fallow period. And we know what we do during fallow periods: We get together and program and talk about what's coming next and we plan."" 
Like many other ensembles, A Far Cry replaced its docket of canceled concerts (including its March 31 debut at the Kennedy Center) with intimate living room webcasts and assorted online offerings - though Darling has quickly developed an allergy for the orchestral montages currently sweeping the Internet. The trick has been finding ways to feel like their creative unit is staying true to itself, despite its members being scattered around and stowed away. 
""We're looking for the things that feel the most complete for us, artistically,"" says Darling. 
She's been struck by the sense of comfort and closeness that has characterized the mass-migration of artists and listeners to virtuality - where everyone is in the same boat, or at least in the same live stream; but the unblinking eye of the webcam is itself a far cry from the presence of an audience. It doesn't quite fill the void between her, her fellow players and their listeners. It is the void. 
""It is so hard to play for a little camera,"" she says. ""It's so different than playing to an audience. . . . I know I have to believe it's reaching people, but I can't feel it. I just can't feel it. People who are good at this know how to look beyond the eye. We've just all got to get there, but it's going to take a lot of generosity of spirit to get there."" 
It's also going to take some endurance. As artists of all sorts adapt to a world removed from the world they make art about, the challenge of day-to-day isolation seems less of a concern than the long-term question of what their art will become - or what will become of their art. 
""I don't know if you run at all,"" Darling says. (I don't.) ""But in a way it's the same thing as starting a symphony. You sort of know at the beginning that you're going to be onstage for an hour; you're going to be out on the course for a few miles. And no matter how you feel at the beginning, you know this whole thing is coming. The way you feel at the beginning probably won't have a lot to do with the way that you feel later on in the process."" 
Of course, this is a race with no finish line. Or an unfinished symphony. 
""That is true,"" she says, and we share a sigh over the phone. ""All you know is that you're going to be running 
for a while.""",4/12/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,8
72,Teens are equipped to handle isolation,"Schools are shut down, sports have come to a halt, and teenagers won't be attending their senior proms. 
In times of loneliness and isolation, how are kids coping and maintaining relationships? 
The same way they have been since before the new world of social distancing - FaceTime, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram and video games. 
Social media usage among teens is something that has concerned parents and teachers for years, with each subsequent generation seemingly more addicted to electronics than the one before. But it might end up being the thing that saves them. 
At a time when mental health professionals are increasingly concerned over the impact of unexpected and unprecedented isolation, children could be the ones who make it through with the least trauma. Because unlike older Americans, adolescents are used to communicating largely through virtual media. It's their 
normal. 
Autumn Viney, a senior at Braden River High School in Bradenton, Florida, is sad that her classmates won't be able to experience the things that other kids have. Walking at graduation has always been one of her biggest dreams, and now she probably won't be able to experience it. She's a self-described workaholic, both at school and on the job. 
With social distancing and stay-at-home measures, social media has been ""a blessing"" for her. 
""I have been more in touch than I think I ever have with people,"" Viney said. ""We are all going through the same struggle right now, and it seems like everyone is lonely. It's nice and easy to reach out because everyone is home and on the internet looking for social interactions or some kind of connection during this time."" 
Using Snapchat and video calls on FaceTime makes it feels like she's with her friends even when she's not, 
she said. 
""This is how (teenagers) are used to communicating, so a lot of what's going on and how we're telling them to communicate is what they've always been doing, so they're kind of ahead of us,"" said Jeff Temple, professor and psychologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. 
Hannah DeArmond, a senior at Bradenton's Bayshore High School, is using FaceTime and Snapchat every day now, more than she used to. 
""Everyone is pretty much using (social media) more because we're bored at home with nothing else to do, and it's the only form of us talking to people,"" she said. ""It's how I talk to my friends and make sure they're 
OK."" 
Although schools are closed in Florida until at least May 1, the Manatee County School District's 11 mental health counselors and 22 school psychologists are still working with students. 
The mental health practitioners, including the guidance counselors and social workers, are continuing their services to students using Schoology, the district's online learning system. 
""We're really trying to get these students everything they need,"" said Nicole Cox, ESE director of student",4/13/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2
73,A Star Who Doesn't Mind Being Alone: [The Arts/Cultural Desk],"After experiencing blockbuster success and personal struggles, including a health scare, the ""Endings, Beginnings"" actress has found clarity. 
Shailene Woodley isn't used to being at home. Since she began acting at 5 years old, she's spent much of her life on set in TV shows (""The O.C."" and ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager""), movies (the ""Divergent"" franchise and ""The Descendants"") and more recently, two seasons of the HBO hit ""Big Little Lies,"" in which she played the troubled single mother Jane. 
But now that the coronavirus has upended everything, the 28-year-old Woodley has sheltered at home for the last few weeks, social distancing with no company besides her dog. It's the longest she's lived in her 
own home since she was 17. 
And to be honest? She's kind of loving it. 
""I'm an introvert's introvert,"" Woodley told me this week by phone, ""so this feels like heaven in a lot of ways because I don't have to talk to people, I don't have to deal with people, I don't even have to look at people. I can play the game of being an extrovert when I need to -- it's a big part of my job -- but my happy place is honestly being alone."" 
Normally, Woodley would be gearing up for a press tour to promote her new film, ""Endings, Beginnings,"" but with theaters closed down, the movie will now debut April 17 on digital and on demand May 1. In the romantic drama, directed by Drake Doremus (""Like Crazy""), Woodley plays Daphne, a young woman torn between dating two best friends: Jack (Jamie Dornan), a nice guy offering stability and comfort, and Frank (Sebastian Stan), who's wilder, harder to pin down and better in bed. 
Much of the film is improvised, which posed a unique challenge for Woodley and her co-stars. ""You understand the elements that create that particular person, and you create borders for that,” she said, ""but the thing about a Drake Doremus movie is that you don't really establish a character: You kind of go in as yourself."" 
She also spoke about her new outlook on her career and health problems in her early 20s. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. 
[Video: Watch on YouTube.] 
When you don't know what lines are about to come out of your mouth, how does that change your relationship to who you're playing? 
For me, when I'm building a character, I'm only experiencing different shades and colors of who I personally am. Daphne is one color of me that I got to explore, but I was speaking as Shailene, from a place within my own heart. I think she's a little bit of my alter ego. 
How so? 
When I was 18, I moved into a cabin in the middle of the woods with no cellphone, no Wi-Fi. I'm a loner, and in Daphne, I got to explore some of the more extroverted side of myself who could go out and be free and live with abandon. It was fun to put myself in the position to think, ""If I wasn't worried about the consequences of taking all these drugs and staying at a bar in Silver Lake until 2 a.m., what would that be like?"" Because it's just not something I would allow myself to do. 
How do you approach a love scene differently when there's a level of improvisation to it? 
Luckily, our intimate scenes came toward the end of the shoot, so there was a great level of trust with the actors. In one scene, Sebastian picked me up and took me across the room as the camera followed us, and it was a completely different sex scene than what ended up in the movie. But we had to explore all different parts of these two people's physical nature to really get down to the essence of what worked for this film thematically. 
Was there an intimacy coordinator? 
For me, intimacy coaches make me uncomfortable because it feels like another set of eyes that I don't need. But I have no problem stopping production when I'm uncomfortable, and I don't think that's the case for a lot of people, so I think it's wonderful that there's a lifeline that people can lean on to know they'll be protected. That being said, the best thing a director could do is ask an actor right off the bat: ""What are you comfortable with? What are your boundaries?"" 
There's always a tension to cinematic love triangles where you wonder who the lead character will end up with, but while I was watching ""Endings, Beginnings,"" I did think to myself, ""What would be so wrong with Daphne just continuing to see both men, if that's something that they can make work?"" 
Listen, I'm someone who has experienced both an open relationship and a deeply monogamous relationship in my life, and I think we're in a day and age where there should be no rules except for the ones designed by two people in a partnership -- or three people, whatever floats your boat! But there has to be a 
level of responsibility in any relationship dynamic, and that responsibility is simply honesty and 
communication and trust. Apart from that, it's really none of our business what people choose to do with 
their lives. 
And this situation is not necessarily about Daphne trying to figure out which guy she likes more. It's about them offering different versions of herself she could be, too. 
Absolutely. We're societally conditioned to assume that one person can be our end-all, be-all. This is a concept I've been thinking about often right now, because I'm very much single [after being in a relationship for years with the rugby player Ben Volavola], and I've chosen to be single for a while. The idea of being with someone ... is it only because you've fallen in love with that person, or because there's a newness to understanding yourself because of what that person can offer you? 
Daphne spends much of the movie trying to unpack her past. You're 28 now, nearing the end of your 20s. When you think back to what you were like 10 years ago, how different were you? 
In my late teens, I had a strong idea of my identity and the meaning of my life, but then I went through an abusive relationship. That combined with, honestly, the commercial success I had in this industry began to wear on my strength. My 20s felt a little bit like being in a washing machine, where you're being thrown all over the place. 
As a teenager and as a child, I always thought acting was a hobby, and I never wanted the idea of making it into a career to take away my passion for it. But in my 20s, there was a huge chunk of time where fear and anxiety and competition were definitely at the forefront of my mind and my ego in a way they weren't when I was younger. 
Was that being whipped up by the industry, or were those things deep inside you and you had to learn to deal with them? 
I think it was probably a mixture of both. I haven't spoken much about this yet publicly, and I will one day, but I was very, very sick in my early 20s. While I was doing the ""Divergent"" movies and working hard, I also was struggling with a deeply personal, very scary physical situation. Because of that, I said no to a lot of opportunities because I needed to get better, and those jobs ended up going to peers of mine who I love. They went on to a lot of success, but there was a mix of people saying, ""You shouldn't have let that go!"" or 
""You shouldn't have been sick!"" 
That was combined with my own internal process of, ""Am I going to survive what I'm going through right now and ever be healthy, or even have the opportunity to work on projects I'm passionate about again because of the situation I'm in?"" I was in a place where I had no choice but to just surrender and let go of my career, and it brought out this negative voice in my mind that kept spinning for years and years 
afterward. 
And how are you feeling now? 
Now I'm on the other side of it, thank God. A lot of the last few years has been about focusing on mental health for me, and it's a slow process. But because of that work, I feel very grounded and rooted in who I am and very clear about everything in my life, whether it's my career or my relationships or my own internal 
worth. I feel very grateful to have walked that line of fire, because now I know what I don't want to ever go back to.",4/13/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,neither,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
75,"The Irony of Isolation: Reconnecting With Friends During the Coronavirus Lockdown; Amid social distancing and quarantine, people have rekindled friendships and grown closer to neighbors","As cases of the coronavirus surged, a group of once-close sorority sisters started texting to check in on each other. They had graduated from Boston-area colleges in the 1980s; some hadn't been in touch in years. Soon, the women decided texting wasn't enough. They made plans to talk on a Zoom video call. ""We realized a standard text chain was insufficient,"" says one member, Valarie Davis, a 55-year-old nonprofit 
executive. ""We wanted more."" 
Before the virus, the group had made attempts to meet up over the years, but few women had attended. This time, all 13 surviving sorority sisters were on the call. ""It wouldn't have happened if this crisis hadn't happened,"" says Ms. Davis. ""It was so amazing to see 13 squares of all of us, and I didn't know so much of what was shared."" Her college friends recounted big moments of their lives, including marriages and 
moves. 
There's an irony emerging amid the isolation of social distancing and quarantine: The outbreak has prompted people to grow closer in some ways, as old friends reconnect and neighbors become like family. People have fewer casual interactions, but the relationships that remain have deepened. 
Psychologists say humans have an essential need for social connection. In a recent survey, respondents said the activity they missed most during social distancing was ""gathering with friends, according to an online poll of 4,103 adults by Pittsburgh-based CivicScience. ""Throughout human history we have relied on each other for survival and our brains have evolved to expect proximity to others,"" says Julianne Holt- Lunstad, a psychology professor at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. ""The urge to connect is strong and we are being told that this is dangerous for us. It is like feeling thirsty and being told the water is not safe to drink."" 
A new study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., collected brain activity data in 40 adults by taking scans after periods of 10 hours of fasting and 10 hours of total social isolation. The images showed similar neural responses, supporting the idea that acute isolation causes cravings for social contact similar to how a hungry person craves food.

Who have you reconnected with during this crisis? Join the conversation below. 
""Right now the normal way to fulfill that need for connection is not available, so we are all getting creative about new ways to connect,"" says Rebecca Saxe, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at MIT. 
People are seeking each other out in ways both high tech and low, from videoconferences to exchanges over the backyard fence. Nancy Barrett, a 76-year-old retired systems engineer in Harding Township, N.J., is looking forward to attending a Zoom call with members of her high school class of 1961. Their plans developed after she emailed two former classmates who she hasn't seen in a couple of years. 
Eric Grant, a 25-year-old playwright in Chicago, says he now relishes FaceTime calls after loathing them before the outbreak. ""I always hated FaceTime,"" he says, disliking the pressure to look put together and having to hold up the phone. But now, the face-to-face connection feels reassuring. 
Sometimes, friends just call and put their phones down rather than talking. ""We are trying to replicate that comfort of having friends there, even just sitting in silence,"" he says. He estimates he is now keeping in touch with about 15 friends, about twice as many as he did before the pandemic. Many of the newly close relationships had been on his outer circle-former classmates or childhood buddies, people he might have called every couple of months. ""Now, we're FaceTiming for hours on end every couple days."" 
Relationships between neighbors have changed, too. Ariane Le Chevallier in Portland, Ore., says she craves human connection and relies on her community of neighbors to learn about goings-on, such as front porch meetings at a distance or how well stocked the local grocery store is. 
A group of mom friends in her neighborhood recently emailed one another to check in, an exchange that evolved into a Google Hangouts ""happy hour"" that lasted over an hour. ""All we could talk about was how hard it was to be parents with young kids right now,"" she says. ""It was really therapeutic, drinking wine and talking for an hour and just nice to know that I had people near me going through the same stuff."" 
One neighborhood friend calls every night when she is out on her walk. Normally they would run into each other on the street or in the park without giving it a second thought, she says. ""But now it's this evening phone call and making a really concerted effort to keep in touch."" 
In Silver Spring, Md., Cassie Weaver always liked her neighbors, but never felt so close to them until now. In recent weeks, Ms. Weaver's relationship with Allison Miller and Sara Benhnini evolved from once-a-week playdates and pizza on the porch to the decision to ""close the circle"" among their homes and children. 
In an emotional meeting in the Millers' backyard, the three couples decided that the children benefited from seeing each other and maintaining a sense of normalcy-and the parents could help with child care. But that decision came with self-imposed restrictions, too. ""We said let's self-quarantine like we are one 
12-person family and do it in a way that we can all trust each other,"" says Ms. Weaver. Among a half-dozen rules: No nonessential trips. No playgrounds or playdates. Kids have their own snack bowls and cups. 
""The level of trust is indescribable,"" says Ms. Weaver. ""We are all in this together watching out for each 
other's lives."" 
Ms. Benhnini says she sometimes struggles with whether her decision to get physically closer to her neighbors was the right thing. ""I've had my freakout moments,"" she says. Could someone have forgotten to wash their hands after leaving the grocery store? Did one of the children touch something contaminated outside, potentially bringing it back to the group? But in the end, she thinks the benefits for each of the families outweigh potential dangers. One thing is certain: ""It has turned into a much deeper friendship,"" she says.",4/14/20,0,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,0,3,both risks and benefits,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3
76,Hello in There: Older People and Isolation: [Science Desk],"The coronavirus pandemic could sharpen the health risks of loneliness. But there are ways to connect. 
At midmorning, Lisa Carfagna, a marketing staffer for the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, took a brief break from working at home on Long Island and called the Rubins on the Upper East Side. 
They were doing fine, Seymour Rubin, 89, assured her over a speakerphone. 
""We try to have a project every day,"" said Shirley Rubin, 84. ""Today, I'm making a beef stew for the first time in 40 years."" 
""If I'm here tomorrow,"" her husband put in, ""you'll know it was good."" 
When the coronavirus outbreak forced the Y to shutter last month -- leaving participants in its senior program bereft of their usual lectures, classes and exercise programs -- about 70 staff members quickly volunteered to make weekly calls to all 650 of them. Ms. Carfagna regularly checks in with 25. 
Like many cultural organizations, the Y has turned to digital technology -- streamed concerts and lectures, classes on Zoom, discussion groups via conference call -- to keep its older patrons engaged. 
But computers and smartphones can feel daunting; about a third of Americans over 65 told Pew Research they weren't confident about using digital technology. About half said they needed help in setting up new devices. Some seniors lack broadband connection. 
Besides, ""there's something about that live, person-to-person connection,"" said Julia Zeuner, who directs the senior program and mobilized the volunteers. ""A friendly voice on the other end of the line."" 
Social isolation and loneliness among older adults have become such a concern that two years ago, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine assembled an expert committee to analyze research findings and make recommendations. 
Its report arrived in late February -- as the coronavirus spread. 
Now, older people have been sternly warned to adopt the very practices that, the committee found, can endanger their health. With senior centers, day programs, theaters, parks, gyms and restaurants closed and most in-person visiting prohibited, they are enduring a lengthening period of social separation. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities are barring family members. 
""It's a public health crisis that should be recognized,"" said Colleen Galambos, a committee member and a gerontologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. ""People who normally wouldn't be considered isolated or lonely are now experiencing it."" 
These are not the same state, the National Academies report pointed out. Social isolation refers to an objective lack of social contact with others; loneliness, a subjective sense of being left out and ignored, can strike even when people are surrounded by others. 
By itself, aging doesn't create either problem. But it raises the risks. ""Many older people, especially women over 75, are living by themselves because their spouses died,"" said Dr. Dan Blazer, the committee chair and a psychiatrist at the Duke University School of Medicine. 
Retirement, difficulty driving, hearing and vision loss, cognitive or physical problems that make getting out difficult - all contribute to a troubling tide of disconnection. 
About a quarter of people over 65 living independently in their communities are considered socially isolated, and 43 percent of those over 60 report feeling lonely -- and that was before public health officials instructed older people, and everyone else, to stay home. 
""It's not just touchy-feely stuff,"" said Dr. Ken Covinsky, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, who has been a co-author on studies on loneliness. ""Isolation is a real risk."" 
In fact, it's associated with significantly higher rates of heart disease and stroke and a 50 percent increased risk of dementia, the National Academies report pointed out. Isolated or lonely seniors report a greater incidence of depression and anxiety. 
They suffer a mortality rate comparable to that linked to smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and physical inactivity. 
When the committee looked for promising solutions, it found studies showing that attending exercise programs helped reduce isolation -- not a useful approach at the moment. The evidence for much-heralded technological approaches, from robotic pets and Zoom to voice-activated assistants, remains thin thus far. 
How, then, to help older people maintain their social connections when they're supposed to be socially, or at least physically, distanced? Individuals and organizations around the country are proposing and trying a variety of tactics. 
Dr. Covinsky, particularly concerned about restrictions on visitors to older people at home or in senior facilities, has suggested that as coronavirus testing becomes more broadly available, family members or friends who repeatedly test negative could become ""designated visitors,"" permitted to spend time with their quarantined loved ones. 
""We have restricted something that's pretty essential,"" he said. ""We need to move away from thinking of visitors to old people as optional."" 
In Southern California, two PACE programs -- federally funded efforts to provide full medical and social services for those aging in place -- have leased tablets called GrandPads for their roughly 250 participants. Designed for those over 75, the devices allow seniors to call the PACE center, receive and reply to email, and receive video calls from PACE staff members (and play games). 
At the Queens Public Library in New York, program assistants are calling about 50 homebound patrons each week to remind them of programs available by phone and to check on their well-being, said Madlyn Schneider, the older adult coordinator. 
In Los Angeles, the Motion Picture and Television Fund has fielded a groundswell of new volunteers for its Daily Call Sheet program, which matches them with older people who share their entertainment industry backgrounds. 
The volunteers, once vetted and trained, call once or twice a week. ""It's reminiscing and connecting and fundamental human conversation,"" said Dr. Scott Kaiser, the geriatrician who established the program. 
The Friendship Line in San Francisco similarly operates a ""warmline, though without the industry link. It has also seen a surge in users, and so many new volunteers that it has resorted to a waiting list. 
Dr. Blazer reports that the drivers delivering Meals on Wheels to his 96-year-old mother-in-law in suburban Atlanta, instead of just dropping off food as usual, now tap on her door and chat from across the hallway of her independent living building. ""They have a conversation from six feet away,"" he said. ""She says it makes a huge difference."" 
However heartened by such efforts, Dr. Blazer cautioned that ""social isolation isn't going away."" He worries about what will happen when some degree of normalcy dawns -- and millions of isolated or lonely elders recede from public attention. 
""We'll find ways to adapt to this, but my hope for older people is that we don't forget them,"" he said. ""If this epidemic has taught us anything, it's that we have to reach out."" 
Individuals can do that, too. My friend Peg Rosen, a freelance writer in suburban New Jersey, has begun FaceTiming with her mother-in-law in Manhattan every morning. 
They work the New York Times crossword puzzle together, just as they used to on Sundays in a city coffee shop, a pleasure now forbidden them. (To subvert generational stereotypes, it's Ms. Rosen, 56, who prefers doing the puzzle on paper; the 87-year-old is using her tablet.) 
""It's delightful, a highlight of my day,"" Ms. Rosen reported. ""I think we'll continue when this all ends.""",4/14/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9
77,Psychology of isolation: Experts offer insight on how children cope with the crisis,"Newsday is opening this story to all readers as we provide Long Islanders with news and information you can use during the coronavirus outbreak. All readers can learn the latest news at 
newsday.com/LiveUpdates 
Now that Long Island is approaching a month into social distancing, psychologists are considering what effects isolation is having on children and families, and what the long-term impacts may be. 
""We are all very wired to be social,"" says Debra Reicher, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Stony Brook University. Children especially are dependent on their peers, therapists say. 
Families may be experiencing the stress of being cooped up in shared spaces, especially if they live in apartments. Parents may be fighting with each other - or with their kids - as they get on each other's nerves. Families may be dealing with financial stress. 
Some psychologists are also concerned about what it will be like when we try to reenter the world after so 
much time cocooned. 
Yet for many families, psychologists say, this time may offer positives. ""In a certain sense, kids have been on social overload, Reicher says. They've been having playdates since the time they were still using a pacifier. This pause may allow families to strengthen their relationships, she says. 
Different ages, different needs 
Amy Langbart of Lido Beach, who has three daughters, has been experiencing how the different age groups seem to need varied types of parental support in adjusting to their upended lives. 
Delaney, 20, is juggling online social work classes through Adelphi University, trying to meet the requirements for fieldwork when there's no field to go to. Blake, 17, is in her senior year at Long Beach High School and is disappointed about potentially missing milestones such as graduation. And Kelsey, 12, is having the toughest time of the three, struggling to master school assignments from afar and practicing 
her viola over the internet with a friend from school. 
At the same time, Langbart and her husband, Adam, who own Merrick Woods Country Day School, are navigating their own challenges of maintaining a business that is currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""It's like a house of cards, Langbart says of the emotional reality of their new stopped-short lives. ""It's all great, and then 10 minutes later it all comes tumbling down. If I had an end date, then you could almost enjoy the time we have off. But everything is too uncertain."" 
Here are some Long Island psychologists' thoughts about the effects of social isolation on families: 
Pre-K: Internalizing house moods 
The youngest children don't have a strong sense of the passage of time, says Rona Novick, a psychologist from West Hempstead and author of the children's book, ""Mommy Can You Stop the Rain?"" ""What they're thinking about is 'Maybe tomorrow we can go play. This is boring. I don't like this."" 
She predicts preschool-aged children may have the easiest adjustment to being at home for an extended period. ""I guarantee you we will not have to drag children to playgrounds. It will come back like riding a bike."" 
Parents shouldn't underestimate, however, what even the youngest children might be internalizing from the mood of the house, says Joaniko Kohchi, director of the Institute for Parenting at Adelphi University, which focuses on children from birth to age 6. 
""Young children are supposed to think the world revolves around them. If a young child sees their parents fighting, they think it's their fault, Kohchi says. Explain to them that they haven't done anything wrong. ""Don't try to pretend that something that happened right in front of them didn't happen."" 
Elementary: Struggles with schoolwork 
Getting schoolwork done can be a source of frustration for elementary school students, especially when children don't have the social comparison they get from being in the classroom, says Jennifer Keluskar, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Stony Brook University. For instance, if the teacher gives a very hard assignment, children don't see that their peers are struggling as well. If mom or dad can't download an assignment, they don't see many other parents can't do it either. 
""These poor babies,"" says Katiuscia Gray, a social worker who practices in Valley Stream, and who, along with her business partner Amanda Fludd, has transitioned to counseling families virtually. ""I've been talking to kids who have anxiety. Their routine has been shifted dramatically"" 
Many educators realize this. Long Beach Schools Superintendent Jennifer Gallagher sent this email home to offer perspective to district parents: ""Twenty years from now, your children will not remember what they learned during the spring of 2020... honestly, they won't. They WILL remember the time they stayed home with you (or whoever is caring for them) for a few weeks. They will tell their own children about feeling safe, and loved, and peaceful during an anxious time."" 
Some therapists worry certain kids will become too comfortable with being at home. Especially children on the autism spectrum may find it a relief not to have to face the social anxiety of going to school, 
Reicher says. 
Middle school: Staying social, virtually 
Of Langbart's three daughters, she's most concerned about Kelsey, a sixth-grader. ""Her whole life is going to school and hanging out with friends. Last night she asked me when I thought we would get back to normal. I said, 'In May, it should get back to normal' and she burst into tears. It's heartbreaking."" 
But Kelsey says she's trying to stay upbeat. ""We've already gone through a few weeks and it's gone pretty quickly. That kind of calms me down,"" she says. 
Social issues can still exist, says Laurie Zelinger, a child psychologist in private practice in Cedarhurst. For instance, a child might not be invited to a group Zoom chat. If they misunderstand a text message, it may take a while until that gets repaired. ""They're not going to see that kid in school in a few minutes to see what their behavior is like,"" Zelinger says. 
Psychologists say they worry about the middle school and high school age group isolating in their rooms, sleeping until 3 p.m., losing motivation to do anything, and becoming depressed. Experts suggest encouraging kids to get up in the morning and establish a routine for the day. 
Kids may also grow from this experience, Keluskar says. ""There's a lot of potential for some really nice things to happen in the long term,"" she says. ""Learning to adapt to changes and be more flexible, there is a lot of potential for kids to grow in that way."" 
High school: A great sense of loss 
""Teenagers are feeling an enormous sense of loss,"" West Hempstead's Novick says, especially seniors missing events such as prom or graduations. ""They're thinking, 'It's all gone. I can't believe I didn't get it. It's not fair."" Kids who are dating aren't able to see their boyfriends or girlfriends. 
Telling them that next year you can be in the school play is not at all helpful, Novick says. Instead, validate their feelings. Let them be sad before trying to problem solve with them, Novick says. 
Older kids may have more fortitude to rise to the occasion, Stony Brook's Reicher says. 
That's what Rowan Simpson, 15, a high school sophomore from Huntington, is trying to do. ""I've been 
working out a lot. I've been baking. I have something in the oven right now, oatmeal sandwich cookies. I have to restring a guitar. We've been going on family walks, too."" 
Looking to the future 
""I wouldn't want parents to think, 'This is scarring my child for life. I think that's unnecessary and unrealistic,"" Novick says. 
But it may take time to reenter the world. 
Langbart says she thinks it's going to take a while for people to sit next to a stranger at the movies, eat dinner in a crowded restaurant with tables close together. ""Even hugging people or shaking hands,"" she says. ""I think things that never fazed us at all, it's going to take a long time to be unfazed by it again.""

79,Coronavirus Lockdown Lessons—From Antarctica; The crew at Troll station are used to isolation. They have advice to help us avoid the Jack Nicholson route in 'The Shining',"Deep in the Antarctic, Karin Jansdotter and her companions have been in isolation since November. This spring, much of the world joined them . 
The staff at Troll, a Norwegian scientific-research station 2,350 miles from the nearest city, have watched for weeks as people from Australia to New York struggle to endure lockdowns placed to control the spread of the coronavirus. Friends and family are still adjusting to a life that those on Antarctica are well-practiced in-seeing the same people and rooms every day-for months at a time. 
There's one key difference: Those at Troll station feel lucky to be on the one continent that has yet to report a case of Covid-19. 
For Ms. Jansdotter, friends who once said she was crazy for working in this environment are turning to her for advice on isolation. 
""I would never have thought that the rest of the world would be doing the same as I am doing now,"" said Ms. Jansdotter, Troll's chef and team leader. ""It is utterly bizarre."" 
This time of year, as winter approaches in Antarctica, there is only a small staff at the station, manning equipment that collects data. In February, the summer crew flew out, and Troll's airfield was closed down for the season. In May, the sun will set and not rise again until August. 
In winter, temperatures fall to below minus 40 degrees. 
On a recent evening, Troll's six-person team put together a list of advice for those struggling with extended lockdowns. Among their suggestions for families cooped up: 
Give people space...folks have to be allowed time on their own to read books, listen to music, watch 
television. 
Don't let problems linger and get bigger-talk about it from the start. 
Stay active, and even if you are in a small place, move furniture and get fit. 
Share Your Thoughts 
What has helped you during lockdown? Join the conversation below. 
Call a friend you haven't spoken to in a long time. 
Most of all, Ms. Jansdotter said, everybody has to slow down. 
""Take a deep breath, this is a time to be curious,"" she said. 
Antarctica hosts around 70 research stations, including the U.S. Antarctic Program, spread around a continent that is around 5.4 million square miles. 
At Britain's Rothera Station, Kelly Hogan, a marine geophysicist, advises those locked down to keep up communication with friends and family-and talk with them about how they feel about their situation. ""It is always reassuring to know that other people feel the same way as you,"" she said. 
Also: Get a hobby, she said. At Rothera, staff members have taken up knitting and crocheting, bringing special wools and patterns to follow from home. Staffers at both Rothera and Troll suggest learning to play a musical instrument. 
Luke Keehan, an engineer and electrician who is in his second stint at New Zealand's Scott Base in Antarctica, said it is essential to give people time on their own. ""Not disturbing people in their rooms or if they have headphones on can be a good start,"" he said. 
Before lockdowns around the world took hold, Ms. Jansdotter, 33, would typically FaceTime her parents once or twice a week. Now it's four times. Communication in a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend -he is the Netherlands-just got easier. Most recently surfing in Mexico, he is now holed up in the Dutch city of Haarlem, and able to talk more, she said. 
As everybody else's social life declines, those at Troll station have never been so busy-with staffers able to be part of festivities that friends back home are now putting online. 
Ms. Jansdotter joined friends in Norway and the Netherlands for an online party. Roald Klingsheim, an electrical engineer, joined the quiz team from the Gnu bar in Stavanger, Norway, that he drinks with when 
he's back home. 
""It was a neat opportunity to see friends,"" he said. ""Although peculiar, as they were all isolated in their own 
homes while I was isolated down here."" 
To beat homesickness, people bring reminders of where they come from. Alex Sola, Troll station's electrician, brought Norway's full national costume, the Bunad, including embroidered waistcoat, knee- length woolen socks and breeches. 
On Rothera, Ms. Hogan said she has a toy bird from her young daughter, which tweets ""in a strange drawn- out way"" when you press its stomach. 
A British-Norwegian group established the first base in 1899, and the U.K. did much of the early exploration of Antarctica. The Norwegians, though, beat them to the geographic South Pole in 1911. 
The first known expedition to spend an entire winter isolated in the Antarctic did so after being trapped in ice in 1898. Two members of the Belgian-led group were certified insane on returning home, according to Michael Smith, who has written 10 books on polar exploration. 
In general, polar explorers have dealt well with isolation and lockdown, by imposing routines on their lives, keeping fit and arriving well-prepared, he said. 
For a 1908 expedition, Ernest Shackleton brought a printing press, so his crew could create their own book of poems, stories and humor, called the Aurora Australis. Fellow Brit Edward Parry took women's clothes, wigs and makeup on his all-male expeditions to the Arctic in the early 19th century. That was to put on shows for what he called the Royal Arctic Theatre, Mr. Smith said. 
Ms. Jansdotter first caught what she calls the ""polar bug"" in 2012, while serving as the chef on a cruise ship that sailed into the northern polar region. 
She landed at Troll last November for a stay of about a year. 
With winter approaching, the few birds that inhabit Queen Maud Land, the slice of Antarctica claimed by Norway, have left, leaving no wildlife around Troll. 
People should take comfort from their surroundings no matter how hostile they seem at first, said Ms. Jansdotter, describing the beauty of the glacier she can see from her office window as ""super turquoise"" in the sunlight. 
Ms. Jansdotter describes small hikes, when the weather allows, to places few have ever been. ""You can see the earth curve on the endless ice, you can hear the ice moving, cracking and groaning, below you,"" she said, looking from her window across Antarctica.",4/16/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,neither,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6
82,Astronauts shed light on how to navigate life in isolation,"Don't count the days. Tallying them, like etches on a prison wall, will only serve as a reminder of how interminable the coronavirus quarantine is, how insufferably abnormal, each mind-numbing day building unmercifully into a contagion of its own. 
""I have no idea how many days I've been in quarantine. None,"" said Scott Kelly, the former NASA astronaut who spent 340 days in space, the record for the longest single spaceflight by a U.S. astronaut. ""I don't think about it. I just think, this is my reality. This is my mission. And it will someday be over."" 
Today, instead of being confined on the International Space Station with a handful of crewmates, he's restricted to his 1,200-square-foot, two-bedrooms-with-den apartment in Houston with his wife. But his philosophy is the same, as is his strict adherence to routine, laid out daily on a shared Google calendar. He sets his alarm for 7 a.m., eats breakfast, ""then work goes to noon, and then lunch, and then work, and then physical training, then plan for the next day, then dinner, then free time."" 
Astronauts have a lot to teach us about how to survive the great covid-19 lockdown of 2020. So do explorers and scientists. And the researchers who study them say their experiences - confined in a spacecraft in orbit, a ship at sea or an outpost in Antarctica - can shed light on how we can best navigate an unsettling time that in its darkest moments can feel like an unjust incarceration. 
Since the outbreak hit the United States, astronauts have been eagerly offering up their wisdom, urging those of us not used to forced isolation and social distancing to exercise, stay productive and be positive, find creative outlets, revel in nature, stick to a schedule, reach out to loved ones, and reconnect with old 
friends. 
But don't count the days, at least according to Kelly. In space, like now, he assiduously tried to will himself into a tolerable ignorance despite repeated reminders of milestones - 100 days to go! - from ground controllers and crewmates. 
""Drove me crazy,"" he said. 
NASA has long been interested in human interactions among astronauts, especially as it looks toward long-duration spaceflight, when people could be cooped up together for long periods. Between 2003 and 2016, it selected astronauts to keep journals that would then be analyzed. The project was led by Jack Stuster, a psychologist and anthropologist who had researched the behavior of explorers, such as Ernest Shackleton, who had led long-duration missions to remote corners of the Earth, and wrote a book about it 
titled, ""Bold Endeavors."" 
After reading the astronauts' diaries, he concluded that they ""share an unusually well-developed sense of self-awareness."" Which came as a bit of a surprise. 
He had read ""The Right Stuff"" by Tom Wolfe, about John Glenn and the rest of the Mercury 7 astronauts, and so Stuster had thought astronauts ""tended to be overly confident and certainly unwilling to admit to possessing flaws or normal human frailties."" But instead, social distancing for long periods in orbit revealed that even NASA's finest were endearingly human. 
""What a day it has been,"" one astronaut confessed into the assigned diary. (All the participants did so under the agreement that their journals would remain anonymous.) ""Today started with urinating in the bag so that set the tone for everything."" 
""I think I do need to get out of here. Living in close quarters with people over a long period of time, definitely even things that normally wouldn't bother you much at all can bother you after a while,"" wrote another. ""That can drive anybody crazy"" 
""I could tell there was some stress in the air because there were a couple very short tempered exchanges between us this morning,"" wrote another. 
Stuster said there are similarities between coronavirus quarantine and a long sea voyage gone awry. (While he's never studied the particular anthropology and pathos of cruise ships, they might be fertile ground for inquiry as the pandemic leaves many stranded at sea.) In 1898, an exploration team locked in Antarctic ice suffered through the winter by holding beauty contests of illustrations of women ripped from magazines in the ship's library and got exercise by taking what they called a ""madhouse promenade"" on the ice around the ship. 
""They had senses of humor back then,"" Stuster said. 
To prepare for long-duration spaceflight, NASA has been working with the University of Hawaii, which has been simulating Mars missions by confining small groups at remote outposts for months at a time to study how they interact. 
- 
One of the coping mechanisms crews developed was to celebrate everything - breaking up the mundane with holiday-like events that turned half birthdays and even National Hot Dog Day into parties to look forward to. 
""Anything they can do to make a day special,"" said Kimberly Binsted, a professor at the University of Hawaii and the principal investigator of the Mars simulation project. 
Today, during the novel coronavirus pandemic, chefs are leading lessons on how people in quarantine can cook what's in their pantry. And newspapers, such as this one, are running stories like: ""Making yogurt at home is easier than you think."" Or. ""It's time to relax and figure out how to mix a drink with what you have."" 
When Binsted was on a mission in the Arctic, one of her crewmates from Quebec was getting homesick. So one Sunday, they made him poutine, or their best approximation of the French Canadian dish, given what they had. 
""It took forever because we didn't have potatoes, so we had to reconstitute these scalloped potatoes from a box and fry those,"" she said. ""We made cheese from dehydrated milk, and eventually presented him something which was only slightly like poutine."" 
Binsted insists the hydrated, reconstituted vaguely poutine-esque concoction, awful as it sounds, was actually tasty. 
Recently during ""Yuri's Night,"" a celebration to commemorate Yuri Gagarin becoming the first person in space, Kelly had a video conversation broadcast on the Internet with Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead about space, isolation and music. Weir had spent years on the road touring, and Kelly asked Weir what advice he had for those in quarantine. 
""File off the edges,"" Weir responded. ""Because if you have rough edges, there are going to be some scars."" 
Music, Kelly added, is also important. On the space station, the crews would get together for dinner on Friday and Saturday, and he would play music on his iPad. 
""I have pretty eclectic taste, from classical to rap,"" he said. ""I'd often bring Coldplay, Pink Floyd, sometimes the Dead. The cosmonauts loved whatever I brought to those dinners. But I'm curious - if you were on the space station right now on a Saturday night, what album would you want to play?"" 
""Probably it would be Miles Davis's 'Kind of Blue, "" Weir said. ""Everyone loves that, from the first notes of the first song, 'So What!"" 
It's a track that starts slow, disorganized, then builds out a theme - bass, piano, drums and then that trumpet, both plaintive and celebratory, the kind of tune you can listen to over and over and still hear something new. An anthem for a quarantine. 
Isolation blurs the lines between monotony and boredom, solitude and isolation, loneliness and being alone. But the distinctions are important. No one knew that better than Michael Collins and Al Worden, two NASA astronauts during the Apollo moon missions who stayed behind in orbit around the moon while their 
crewmates walked on the lunar surface. 
Throughout their careers, both were asked whether they were lonely. 
""You can be lonely anywhere,"" Worden told The Post in an interview last year before his death. ""I can be lonely right in the middle of town. Being alone means there's no one else around. Now I know I was alone in lunar orbit for three days, but I was not ever lonely."" 
Likewise, while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin pranced on the surface of the moon, and Collins flew on the far side out of radio contact with Earth, he thought, ""I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life. I am it."" For those keeping score, he wrote, that would be ""three billion plus two on the other side of the moon, and one - plus God knows what - on this side."" 
Former NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson was the only American not on Earth during the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and endured his own version of isolation. Traveling in the space station some 250 miles high, he could see the column of smoke rising from New York City, where the twin towers had been hit. A former naval aviator, he snapped into action, taking photos and relaying what he was seeing to the ground in case another attack was being planned. Still, he felt a disorienting sense of detachment, compounded by dread and helplessness. 
""It was a feeling of isolation and frustration that we couldn't do more to help the people down on Earth,"" he 
said. 
Wernher von Braun, the legendary NASA engineer known as the father of the Apollo-era Saturn V rocket, wrote in the 1950s that on a lengthy trip to Mars, even ""little mannerisms - the way a man cracks his knuckles, blows his nose, the way he grins, talks or gestures - create tension and hatred which could lead to 
murder."" 
In one of his astronaut studies, Stuster concluded that ""such a grim outcome is unlikely."" 
And indeed, last week, NASA's crew on the space station seemed to be getting along quite well. During an interview with reporters they were gracious and friendly and even ended with a synchronized, weightless backflip, arms locked together. 
Still, Jessica Meir, who had been on the station since September, said it was ""quite surreal for us to see this whole situation unfolding on the planet below."" 
From space, she said, there were no visible signs of the turmoil the pandemic is causing. 
""We can tell you that the Earth still looks stunning as always from up here,"" she said. 
Chris Cassidy had just arrived for this third trip to space. Normally, astronauts spend two weeks in quarantine before launching to avoid bringing bugs to the space station. He knew that was going to be the case again for this flight. 
What he didn't know, he said, was that ""the whole rest of the world was going to join us.""",4/17/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,5,7

84,"This is devastating for us': For those in nursing homes, and their visitors, coronavirus isolation takes a toll","Before the coronavirus pandemic, Suzanne Heuberger visited her parents several times a week at The Selfhelp Home on West Argyle Street. 
She would join them for meals, sit with them during concerts, drop in with her friends. 
""I pretty much went there like every day, if not every other day,"" she said. ""It was great, because they had so many activities."" 
Those get-togethers abruptly stopped a few weeks ago, as isolation became essential at nursing homes and senior residences across the country. As these institutions confronted rising death tolls amid an acutely vulnerable population, social distancing became a paramount concern. 
Now Heuberger can visit her 89-year-old mother only from a distance -- and from the other side of glass. 
""This is devastating for us,"" said Heuberger. ""I get it, that we can't go in. ... Any time my mom wants to come down to the lobby, she's allowed to come down to the lobby. I talk to her like we're in prison. 
""She has a cellphone. Thank God she knows how to operate the cellphone. That keeps us going.... I'm wondering, if (residents) don't make it through, is it a COVID-19 death? I'm stressed to the max. I told my doctor I think I need a Xanax. I'm not sleeping. I'm super stressed out. I always want to cry. 
""It's just really painful."" 
For Heuberger's mother, as for elders across the country, life in an assisted living facility or nursing home (the two often are under the same roof) has meant a new degree of separation from loved ones and from 
the outside world. 
""I'm a nervous wreck -- of course, I'm fine,"" said Vera Heuberger, Suzanne's mother, expressing a duplicity of feelings 
Before the quarantine, life ""was tremendous,"" she said. ""I have a beautiful facility here. I always tell (people) I'm in a Hilton Hotel room. ... Suzanne could come every day after work. 
""Now we're talking and seeing each other through the glass door in the hallway. And I have the phone, and she has the phone."" 
Both Suzanne and Vera Heuberger hasten to add that The Selfhelp Home, like many other institutions, has been working assiduously to try to combat the added isolation and loneliness that shut-in seniors may feel at this time. Though residents mostly are confined to their individual rooms, strategies -- including those vestibule visits -- have been designed to try to keep them connected to each other and to their relatives and 
friends. 
""I can't hug her, I can't kiss her, OK,"" said Vera Heuberger. ""But I can see her, and that already is incredible, and chat with her as long as we want to. Half an hour, an hour. As long as we want to gossip."" 
Meeting through a window is just one of many methods these institutions quickly have developed in the face of the pandemic. 
""One of the most challenging things to prepare for during this period is that loss of connection the residents are feeling,"" said Efrat Dallal, chief marketing officer at The Selfhelp Home. 
""Mealtime in the dining room is one of the most social points of the day. As soon as community contact came to an end, all our activities and concerts had to be canceled. We quickly had to shift gears and find ways to keep the residents connected."" 
They did so by establishing an in-house TV channel that delivers announcements, displays residents' photos, screens films and offers other diversions. 
""We immediately launched an iPad drive, reaching out to our families and our volunteer community,"" said Dallal. ""Now we have enough iPads to make sure our residents can FaceTime and Zoom with family 
members. 
""Our population is 80s and 90s and higher -- the introduction of technology was not so easy. But through all this we've taught many of them how to use it, and it's been very rewarding. The iPads have also helped them stay connected to each other. 
""We set up ladies that (used to) dine together, and they missed dining together. So we set them all up with their own iPads during dinner time, and we set up a Zoom with them. They chatted for over an hour, each from her own room. 
At Montgomery Place, on South Shore Drive, executives and other staff decided to move into the facility starting March 13. 
""We were here 24/7 for the first two weeks,"" said Stefanie Dziedzic, chief relationship officer. ""When things mellowed out a bit, we were able to go into a rotation. 
""The purpose of that was being really the makeshift family for our residents, so they had consistent faces, consistent messaging, so they didn't feel more alone. 
""When you wake up in the middle of the night and are scared, the people you know are here."" 
Montgomery Place and other institutions decided early on that if the residents couldn't come to the activities, the activities would come to the residents. 
""We instituted Happy Hour,"" Dziedzic said. ""Now that the residents have been in isolation for 14 days, the risk is pretty low. We're bringing in a bar cart to the floors, and we're setting up a makeshift bar in the lobby, so people can get out and socialize a little more,"" at a safe distance. 
""We're delivering meals to every floor three times a day, so they get to see a lot of the staff members and interact with (them)."" 
Even so, this ongoing and indefinite period of isolation inevitably ""seems long,"" said Ida Watanabe, 81, who has lived at Montgomery Place with her husband for more than two years. 
""But I've just tried to maintain an attitude of one day at a time and figuring out: Well, we'll get to another day, and what's that going to take? 
""I spent 30 years as a social worker, so I've tried to rely on that training. I try to remember, to understand how it can -- if you let it -- play tricks on you. And not allow us to get depressed. 
""I know you have to find ways to keep going and reach out. That's important: to reach out."" 
Among those Watanabe stays in touch with is her son, who lives in the neighborhood. 
""Of course, it's difficult not being able to spend time with them in person,"" said Scott Watanabe, who used to dine with his parents every week at Montgomery Place. 
""I have a lot of peace of mind knowing that they live in a building with on-staff nurses."" 
For 95-year-old retired schoolteacher and principal Paul Bruce, who lives at Montgomery Place, ""It was a little depressing at first not to see anybody,"" he said. 
""But (when) the weather seems warmer, we have a garden here, we can go down and walk in the garden. 
""They bring wine and cheese up to you and give it to you at your door."" 
Though Bruce has ""outlived everyone in my family by about 30 years, he said, he fills his days talking to friends on the phone and reading. 
As for the psychological stress of this period, ""I personally have not heard of any significant cases of depression, but we're very straight about it,"" said Dziedzic, the Montgomery Place chief relationship officer. 
""We talk about it and give tips about what people can do to avoid falling into the doldrums. We share tidbits. We call it out. 
""We say: It's frustrating. It's really frustrating. We get it. So here are things you might want to think about and share tips along the way to keep them positive. We also did an internal positivity campaign with fun things: Be like a proton and stay positive. They seem to be responding well to it. They're all very gracious. 
""Initially, there were some people who didn't take this seriously and felt we were overreacting and were pretty resentful about some of the restrictions that had gone into place. But even the people who have been dragging their heels have come around."" 
At some institutions, residential hallways have become the new activity centers. 
St. Joseph Village on West Belmont Avenue, a ministry of the Franciscan Sisters of Chicago, recently celebrated Palm Sunday by having ""people draw palms to put on their doors,"" said Dawn Mayer, vice president of mission integration and pastoral care. 
""When they open their doors and look out, they (would) see a procession of palms down the hallway on the doors. We (had) people decorate their doors for Easter, so people can open their doors and see life and beauty are still around them."" 
At The Admiral on the Lake, on West Foster Avenue, ""We've had our staff walk through hallways -- with full- on protective gear -- play music, sing to those in doorways,"" said executive director Nadia Geigler. 
Some residents have ""decided to meet in the thresholds of their doorways, at a safe distance, for happy hours. Everybody brings their glass of wine and chats for a little bit. 
""We're also wanting to make sure we're paying attention to folks who are struggling. Maybe they don't have access to technology. They might feel a lot more cut off. Our staff is paying individual visits to those folks, checking in on them to make sure they're not feeling too lonely. 
""There are (residents) who have raised their hands to say, 'I'm feeling a little lonely! Others have said, 'I'm happy to call somebody! 
""They're paired up."" 
To further boost spirits, Admiral residents council president Toni Smith sends ""funny emails two or three times a day to all the residents who have computers,"" she said. 
These include tweets and other postings, such as: 
""Gas is finally affordable, and we can't go anywhere!"" 
""Critical advisory: 8 p.m. is now the official time to remove your day pajamas and to put your night pajamas 
on."" 
The Admiral has continued its long-running program of bringing in guest speakers. Each arrives at the front desk, has his or her temperature checked, then steps outside to enter the auditorium from an exterior door. The speaker sits in an empty auditorium with a lone camera operator (who broadcasts the talk via the in- house TV channel) and Smith, who fields post-lecture questions from residents via text and email. 
Mask-making projects at the Admiral, Montgomery Place and other venues also keep residents busy and contributing. 
And though Suzanne Heuberger and her parents miss having Sabbath dinner together at The Selfhelp 
Home, which was designed to ""accommodate the needs of older Jewish adults,"" the sacred Friday evening 
tradition continues. 
""Shabbat has always been very special here -- residents dress up,"" said Dallal, the Selfhelp executive. 
""Since the first week of our quarantine, we promised to keep the tradition of lighting candles, saying Kiddush (a Hebraic prayer). Our hashtag is: Shabbat is never canceled. 
""We created a Shabbat car, with challah and wine and candles, and we have music playing. 
""They stay at their doorways,"" added Dallal, referring to residents who find Shabbat coming to them. 
""The first week, we caught some of them by surprise. The second week, we noticed that they were ready and dressed. OK! 
""We're trying to create a new sense of something familiar and normal. Our staff has been really heroes through all this. We've made T-shirts that say 'heroes, signs all over the building that say we're all heroes. 
""I'm on the verge of crying all day.""

87,Lockdown Is a Stress Test for Relationships; The adversity of the pandemic and isolation is an emotional magnifier.,"The Covid lockdown has been a harsh experience for one of my patients, a young professional woman. Isolated with her family in their second home, outside New York City, she has gotten in touch with her 
resentment of and dissatisfaction toward her husband. 
The stress of being confined together has made her aware that he is consumed with his work, has difficulty connecting emotionally, is uninterested in physical intimacy, and is an unreliable father to their two children. She might have come to many of these conclusions eventually, but the pressure of being together 24/7 at least accelerated the process. 
Being alone together has become a stress test for marriages and other intimate relationships. Media reports suggest a spike in divorce in Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated. Couples who were ambivalent or on the fence about their relationships, or who weren't cognizant of unresolved conflicts, now face the stark reality that they feel claustrophobic, bored and incompatible with their partners. Isolation precludes the possibility of turning outward for happiness, forcing people to reflect upon their own emotional well-being and relationship choices. 
The result isn't always unhappy. Another patient, a 30-year-old man, had difficulty committing to his girlfriend before the lockdown. They decided to share a living space during the lockdown, and he has found their time together joyful-surprisingly affectionate and reassuring. They plan to live together permanently and eventually marry. 
Another couple, long married, have rediscovered their emotional connection. Before the lockdown they spent more time apart than together due to work and social commitments. Now they're talking about how to change their lives after the crisis to prioritize their relationship. 
The stress and adversity of the pandemic and isolation is an emotional magnifier-it reveals and intensifies the reality of every relationship. For some couples it has exposed problems, for others it has cemented loving bonds. As couples spend more time together than ever, fragile relationships will break, while deep ones will grow. Some will end up alone when they return to the real world; others will have learned to prioritize love over busyness.",4/22/20,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,3
89,"How to survive isolation: Drives, hope and Adele: Quad Cities man who did decades in solitary shares tips","Anthony Gay knows what it's like to have his freedom restricted, to crave human interaction and to feel despair. 
But he survived his decadeslong ordeal. And, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, he wants Illinois residents to know they will survive theirs too. 
Gay, who spent 20 years in solitary confinement after being convicted of stealing a hat and a dollar bill, recently launched a blog aimed at helping people cope with feelings of desperation and isolation amid the 
state's stay-at-home order. 
His message is simple: Don't lose hope. 
Cranking up Adele's biggest hits never hurts either. 
""I endured isolation in the extreme, so I understand how people feel right now,"" Gay said in a telephone interview from his Quad Cities home. ""You've got to zone in on the good aspects of life to survive."" 
For the past month, Gay has buoyed his spirits by taking long drives, videoconferencing with family members and reading stories about people who triumph over adversity. He's also watching a lot of Adele videos on YouTube, mesmerized by both the website and a voice he had never heard until shortly before he left prison two years ago. 
""Like Adele setting fire to the rain,"" he wrote in his first blog entry, ""hope must set fire to the pain."" 
And while it might seem incongruous to compare Gay's experience to people who complain on social media about finding decent sushi delivery and having already watched everything on Netflix, he is earnest. His desire to help is genuine, even as he acknowledges that pain to him is not just a song lyric, but something that was a constant companion for years. 
The Rock Island native entered prison in 1994 as a young man, convicted of robbery after brawling with another teen who told police that Gay took his hat and stole $1. Gay expected to serve as little as 3 1/2 
years. 
Instead, a fight with a fellow inmate led to Gay's first stint in segregation, pushing him into a downward spiral that resulted in 22 years in solitary confinement. Shortly after the isolation started, Gay began self- mutilating and attempting suicide. 
Alone for 23 hours a day and starved for human contact, Gay took extreme steps to get attention. He cut himself hundreds of times in his 7-by-12-foot cell, slicing open his neck, forearms, legs and genitals. Once, he packed a fan motor inside a gaping leg wound; another time he cut open his scrotum and inserted a zipper. 
As his mind began to deteriorate, Gay became antagonistic toward his guards and occasionally threw urine or feces at them, unlawful acts of defiance that stretched his original sentence into more than two decades 
behind bars in the Illinois Department of Corrections. 
""The objective was for me to die there,"" he writes in his blog. ""However, I survived. The most compelling reason I survived is because I refused to relinquish hope."" 
As attorneys petitioned again and again for his release, Gay began to feed off their optimism and often turned to them for reassurance. He also found comfort in Guideposts magazine, a publication started in 1945 by religious leader Norman Vincent Peale and filled with stories of inspiration. 
""I never fully closed the door to hope,"" he said. ""It's the only way a miracle can walk through."" 
It's much the same for people struggling with the stay-at-home order, Gay said. They need to cling to whatever buoys their spirits, whether it's a conversation with a good friend or good read. 
""People need to remember that social distancing doesn't have to mean social isolation,"" he said. 
The order comes at a particularly cruel moment for Gay, who had been out of prison for only 18 months when Gov. J.B. Pritzker implemented the statewide restrictions. A proposed state law limiting how long an Illinois prisoner can stay in solitary confinement just had been named in his honor and appeared to be gaining momentum in early March when Illinois skidded to a stop. 
The Anthony Gay Isolated Confinement Restriction Act -- which would bar the Illinois Department of Corrections from placing an inmate in isolation for more than 10 days in a six-month period -- is now in limbo as the legislative session has been suspended because of the outbreak. Though he understands the reason, the slowdown disappointed Gay, who believes he has an obligation to help people in near-hopeless 
situations. 
""It drives me like a heartbeat,"" he said. 
If he can't be assisting inmates in solitary confinement at the moment, Gay decided he could still help people struggling with isolation. Romanucci & Blandin, the Chicago-based law firm representing Gay in a civil rights lawsuit against the IDOC, agreed to publish his pandemic blog on their website to help spread his message. 
""Anthony's blog is so impactful because he, more than anyone else, knows the challenge of being isolated and the power of person's mind in that situation,"" his attorney Nicolette Ward said. ""The hope he had during his years of solitary confinement helped him survive and gave him a vision of better days when he had his freedom. He wants to encourage all Americans to stay hopeful at this challenging time and let people know that things will indeed get better."" 
Like all Illinois residents, Gay has struggled at times with the stay-at-home order and the challenges it presents. He had been working at his cousin's barbershop, which closed in adherence to Pritzker's order, and has not been able to find another job. He's currently living with his mother. 
He has leaned heavily on his church since his release, but has not been able to worship in person with the congregation for nearly a month. On Easter, however, he went to his cousin's church, where he says people were allowed to come in groups of 10 and pray together several pews apart. 
It gave Gay the dose of hope he needed. 
""Trying to abandon hope and achieve success is like trying to get water without the wet, he writes. ""You can't have one without the other.""""",4/22/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,8
90,"Social Isolation's High Physical and Psychological Toll; Studies of polar researchers, astronauts and others in isolation shed light on possible effects of social distancing, including increased forgetfulness, depression and heart attacks","When Newton, Mass., closed its schools in mid-March to help stop the spread of coronavirus, Nataly Kogan was thrilled. No more rushing to get breakfast. Her 15-year-old daughter, Mia, could sleep in. 
The two did puzzles and made videos to post on TikTok. Ms. Kogan thought she would paint. 
""It was bliss,"" she recalls. ""Full-on denial. Those were two of the best weeks of my life."" 
The third week, reality hit. School closures would extend indefinitely. Mia's summer program at Johns Hopkins University was canceled. So was time with friends. 
Ms. Kogan teaches emotional health, she says. It is the subject of her speeches, her books and her company, Happier Inc. But at the end of her third week in isolation, worried about her work and her child, she lost it. She yelled at both daughter and husband, slammed a door and ran out of the house. 
""The feeling of hopelessness is paralyzing,"" she says. 
The changing mood in the Kogan-Spivack household mirrors changes scientists have observed in studies of how polar researchers and astronauts adapt to isolation in situations more extreme than what most people are currently experiencing. In the studies, subjects frequently are gung-ho at the outset, but spirits and energy tend to dip about halfway through an expedition. Days and weeks blur. Productivity often slows 
and relationships fray in what some researchers refer to as the third-quarter slump. That happens, in part, because our circadian rhythms depend not only on light but on social cues. Moods lift again as the isolation nears an end. 
Social distancing is different, of course. But ""some of the lessons apply,"" says Lawrence Palinkas, a University of Southern California professor whose research has taken him seven times to Antarctica to learn how people adapt to prolonged periods of isolation and confinement. 
Zoom sessions and drive-by birthdays aside, ""the fact that face-to-face interaction is missing is very stressful,"" he says. So, too, is confinement with a small group of people, even family, he says. The relentless proximity often turns minor annoyances into major ones. 
Prolonged social isolation takes physical and psychological tolls that are well-documented. Numerous studies link isolation and loneliness to depression, dementia, heart attacks and strokes. The health risk of isolation is equal to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, says Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a psychology and neuroscience professor at Brigham Young University. It shortens lives. 
But isolation takes a toll whether the duration is short or long. In lab studies, ""we can see changes in blood pressure, increases in stress hormones and inflammation"" linked to short-term isolation, Dr. Holt- Lunstad says. Other researchers are studying the impact on immune functioning, cellular aging and sleep disruptions. 
""Humans are a social species,"" vulnerable at birth and safer in a group, Dr. Holt-Lunstad says. ""If we lack proximity to others, our bodies will respond,"" she says. ""Our brains send signals typically associated with fight or flight. We're put on heightened alert."" 
No wonder, then, that isolation tests the dynamics of small groups confined together-whether in space or in homes across the nation. 
""It's important to self-monitor, to defuse feelings,"" says Nick Kanas, an emeritus psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Francisco. His 2015 book on psychological challenges in space made special note of cupolas built into NASA's international space station that allow astronauts to get away from peers 
and observe the Earth. 
There is no equivalent escape hatch for Morra Aarons-Mele in her home in suburban Boston. Ms. Aarons- Mele is an expert at working from home. There, she started a business, wrote a book and started a podcast with the Harvard Business Review called ""The Anxious Achiever."" She has been a speaker at South by Southwest, the arts and conferences festival held in Austin, Texas. 
Now, though, her three young children and her husband, who teaches at Harvard University, are confined at home with her. She has lost her space. Her husband has moved into her office because there is not room for 
another. 
""My husband is trying to help, but he's really messy and it stresses me out,"" she says. She has been working from bed, recovering from what she thinks was Covid-19. 
Some days the whole family fights. At one point, one of the kids told her, "" 'I feel empathy for you and Dad, and I feel scared,"" she says. 
""I've never tried to pull out so many tricks,"" says Ms. Aarons-Mele. ""A lot of audio meditations, and I've taken 
a Xanax here and there."" 
Productivity is a big concern for people working from home, especially with the economy in a tailspin. 
Alison Ledgerwood, psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, says, ""My friends ask, 'What is going on? I don't know why I can't focus!"" After several weeks, Dr. Ledgerwood says she has accepted that ""if I write one sentence of a paper a day-good for me."" 
Social isolation can undermine productivity for reasons that have nothing to do with disrupted routines or family friction. Circadian rhythms are regulated mostly by exposure to light. But they are also affected by social cues, scientists say. Staying confined at home greatly limits external stimuli and can trigger a physiological and psychological response similar to the behavior of animals in hibernation. Study subjects-at the South Pole and in space are apt to slow down, sleep more and get more forgetful, scientists say. 
""They go through a period of physical and psychological torpor,"" says USC's Dr. Palinkas. It's a problem NASA is grappling with as it lays the groundwork for a trip to Mars. 
The polar scientists generally were seen to regain their energy when they knew an expedition would soon end. Nobody knows when social distancing will end. Since lockdowns began, Ms. Kogan has been giving virtual talks to hospital workers from Boston to Rochester, N.Y., on themes of happiness and gratitude. At each, she says, audience members inevitably ask: Do you think something good will come out of this? 
""People are looking for a goal post,"" Ms. Kogan says. ""The bad-case scenarios are so obvious.""",4/23/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,11
95,"FAITH &amp; VALUES: Young folks are lonely, and religion doesn't safeguard them ; Attending services doesn't protect against isolation, survey of youth ages 13-25 finds.","A new survey of teens and young adults found that religious institutions don't make a difference when it comes to combating a serious problem afflicting their generation -- namely isolation and loneliness. 
One in three report they feel completely alone much of the time, according to a recent survey by the Springtide Research Institute. Nearly 40% say they have no one to talk to and feel left out. 
Attending religious services offered no protective barriers, the study found. When young adults living alone during the coronavirus were asked which trusted adults were checking in on them, only 1% said it was someone from their religious home. 
The findings surprised researchers. 
""What we really expected is that this would be a story of young people who didn't have a connection [to religious institutions] and those who did,"" said Josh Packard, executive director of the Springtide Institute, part of the Lasallian Education and Research Initiative based in Winona. 
""We'd ask, 'Where do you feel a sense of belonging?' "" Packard said. ""They would respond with who they felt that with, not where. So it wasn't a matter of connecting with one type of program or another. It was being connected to trusting adults."" 
The survey results were outlined in the report, ""Belonging: Connecting America's Loneliest Generation."" It is based on surveys last fall of a nationally 
representative sample of 1,000 young people between the ages of 13 and 25. Thirty-five of them participated in extensive interviews on the phone or in person. The survey was based on interviews across denominations and faiths. A third, shorter survey was conducted in March to gauge the impact of the 
coronavirus. 
Over 37% of young people surveyed who attend religious groups reported they have ""no one to talk to,"" according to the survey. And more than one in 10 who attend religious groups said they felt ""left out all of the time."" 
""Where we expected to find a buffer between the young person and the rising tide of isolation, we found only more loneliness,"" the report says. 
The major takeaway for religious groups, as well as schools, nonprofits and other groups that work with young people is that it's not so much the program that makes a young person feel a sense of belonging, but rather whether they feel noticed and known. 
""Participation is not belonging,"" the report notes. 
The survey found that the more trusted adults that young people have in their lives the less isolated they feel. If faith groups want to change their lives, the adults need to know their names and get to know them so that ""sense of belonging"" grows. 
Packard calls it ""feeling noticed, feeling named, feeling known."" 
""Our hope is this will be picked up and read widely by youth ministers, pastors, parish organizations,"" Packard said.

99,"After a lifelong struggle with an eating disorder, she has more to fear than coronavirus during self-isolation","At home, I grab an RXBar and a banana. We have more boxes of protein bars somewhere, but I don't want to know where. Last week, as the self- isolation was starting to take hold, my husband, Robert, asked if he should keep backup supplies out of sight and reach. (I'm short, and we have cabinets to the ceiling.) He told me he trusted me (and I believed him) but didn't want me to feel overwhelmed by the sight of so much food. Years past, he'd hide the Halloween candy so that I wouldn't binge on Gobstoppers and Starbursts and skip dinner. This time, it feels like we are in it together - no secrets, just secret stashes. 
Later I go to CVS, where I often get groceries when grocery stores are overwhelming, which is often. With a new set of gloves on, I buy one more Lean Cuisine meal, some Fiber One bars, a family pack of chewy Nerds, a bottle of moscato and cleansing wipes. I look at my cart and wonder if it looks like it belongs to someone with an eating disorder. If so, well, that would make sense. 
My own eating disorder bloomed at age 17 and thrived as much on constant motion as on secrecy. Home has never been a comfort to me. Home is where cabinets full of snacks and other trigger foods await. Home has toilets to clean to hide the evidence of how I got through each day. Home alone, I tended to go to the extremes: wake late, call in sick, binge and slog through a punishing long run - or lie in bed all day. Home has been where I hurt myself. 
But in the fall of 2017, at age 45, I checked into an inpatient treatment center. I was in pain, from working out too much , eating too little, lying all the time. I couldn't keep it up. I didn't want to die, but I didn't want to be in my life anymore. My therapist had told me, a couple of years earlier, that she didn't think I would 
recover without inpatient treatment. I bolted right out of her office then, but I knew she was right. A year and a half later, I walked into a McLean, Va., mansion turned inpatient rehab to so many unknowns:

scheduled meals, no Internet, weigh-ins, roommates half my age, limited movement, and bathroom doors that had to stay open. The walk-in pantry was a carb cornucopia. Two fridges were loaded with Greek yogurt, almond milk, salad greens, fruits, butter and so much cheese - enough to feed a houseful of finally growing girls. 
Another unknown: just how sick I was. On Day 2, the center's doctor told me my dangerously low heart rate almost sent me straight to the hospital. Like so many people living on the edge, I refused to see how close I was to it. Treatment opened my eyes. And in ways I am just realizing, it prepared me for what we're living through now. 
Still, I'm stuck here, trying to do my part in flattening the curve of the novel coronavirus outbreak, with no idea for how long. I'm surrounded by food, cut off from my living. I'm a massage therapist in a time of no touching. I crave and thrive on social interaction. I need people to survive. And for a very long time, I needed complete control over my diet and exercise. I have been getting better, but now I'm super-stressed with so many snacks and other trigger foods piling up and no escape from myself. 
This all feels like a test of recovery. Can I take care of myself and trust others to take care of me? Did all that crafting, journaling, talking about my feelings, meditating, nutritious meal-prepping and coping-ahead strategies pay off? Will my husband see how broken I still am, or how much I want to be alive? 
Monday, March 16 
No clients to see. A whole unscheduled day in front of me? Yikes. 
Robert is at work in D.C., his last day in the office. I need fresh air and exercise. I go for a run and check the mileage when I tire. I'm happy to see it at half of what I once considered a real run. For so long, I let my watch tell me when to stop running. Today I let my body tell me when I'm done. 
Back home I check emails for more closings and scroll through Instagram, where ads for Beachbody, trainer to the stars Tracy Anderson and running shoes remind me that exercise isn't canceled. Maybe I should sign up. I don't want to overdo the running, spin-bike riding, dancing or other at-home options. I'm still terrified of more injuries from overuse and the depression of then not being able to move - and the anger of having no 
control that so often accompanied it. 
As I furiously Google online workouts, a friend texts me. I tell her I'm about to order a mini trampoline. She says she has one that I can come pick up. Am I already being too obsessed with exercise, or am I wisely adding a lower-impact workout to the high-impact types that usually lead to injury? The trampoline is free, I rationalize, and since she just happened to have one, it must be meant to be. Also, my post-treatment tattoo reads ""Boing,"" so bouncing is very on-brand. 
Robert comes home around 6:30, and we trade catastrophe notes. We usually don't eat the same dinner at home, but we try to do it around the same time. He has a significant number of food allergies, and I have a significant lack of food-preparation skills. Recovery takes time. I'm still getting comfortable with eating a variety of foods out in public, and most nights Robert comes home prepared to feed himself, or both of us. He's picked up dinner; I eat a healthy salad with all the foods that scare me: protein, cheese, dressing. I show him my favorite covid-19 meme of the day: ""Your grandparents were called to war. You're being called to sit on your couch. You can do this."" We sit on the couch and share a roll of Spree candies from the secret stash.

Tuesday, March 17 
I stop my spin-bike workout 10 minutes in because Robert has a conference call. Three years ago, he might have just taken the call elsewhere so as to not upset me, but today I don't throw a fit. I adapt. I head upstairs for some calisthenics and moves stolen from Zumba class. The song ""Don't Slack"" comes on, and I record myself dancing and post it on social media, like I'm some kind of cheerleader to keep moving. I'm lonely and ache for community, even if it's just in the comments. 
Robert makes a smoothie and offers me one. I had planned on another protein bar but allow myself to veer from the plan. I add flaxseed and some organic superfood powder to mine, and immediately start counting the calories. I stop mid-calculation to grab my journal. Writing often silences my eating disorder's high pitched commands. It forces me to slow down and see connections. I write five things for which I am grateful. 
I don't weigh myself at home; Robert tossed the scale while I was in treatment. At the doctor's office I turn away from the scale and ask not to be told. But there's a scale at a tiny community gym near our house, and every couple of weeks I sneak a weigh-in just to make sure I haven't gone over a certain number. I know I'm supposed to rely on how I feel or at least on how my clothes fit. In treatment, the therapists and counselors suggested we get rid of pretreatment clothes. I did, but my body has changed a lot in two years, and sometimes it's overwhelming to accept what I see in the mirror, or to see it kindly. 
I attend my first virtual wine and cheese party and drink and talk too much . I find I have a hard time waiting for my turn to talk on Zoom. I should have left the wine bottle in the kitchen. I should have had some cheese. 
Wednesday, March 18 
I wake up with a hangover. Still, my first thought is: When can I work out? 
Robert comes upstairs from working and assures me I can do a workout later. His voice of reason silences the chattering of my eating disorder and echoes my own healthy rationalizations. We've been working on this in outpatient therapy. After telling my therapist that I often wake up afraid - of what hurts, of what's next - she told me to sit with that and observe it. So that's what I do. 
I stretch and massage our dog, Laser. 
I so badly want to go to the gym. I miss Mike, the trainer who has become essential to my recovery, not just because he's helping me listen to my body and strengthen its weaknesses, but because he makes me feel safe. He saw me disappearing with each pound and exposed rib, and these days he reminds me that I am not that person anymore. I could use that reminder about now. 
I call Mom in Indiana to make sure she has enough supplies. The call goes straight to voice mail, so I reach her through Facebook. Turns out she has one phone charger and likely not enough food. I set up a Kroger account and fill her online cart as she guides me over the phone. She wants honey, coffee and Honey Nut Cheerios, also known as sugar, caffeine and carbs. I bark, ""Mom, you need real food,"" my hypocrisy and concern fighting for top billing. How quickly we slip into old roles of me trying to parent her and her assuring me she is taking care of herself.

I can't find my footing today and feel vulnerable. I'm tired of texting. I miss my clients. I miss touch. 
I visit a neighbor whose brother died this week. All I want to do is hug her. Instead, I take out her trash and move her car to a better parking spot, wiping off everything I touch with Lysol. 
My friend Kristen texts. Kristen was there for me during treatment, celebrating my tiniest of victories during frequent visits. She 's binge- eating and doesn't want to trigger me, but she knows I've been there. I call and tell her this is not an uncommon response, especially if you're not used to having that kind of food at home. That this is comfort food's time to shine and for her not to beat herself up. 
I tell her bingeing builds on its own momentum. It gets harder to stop the longer you go. It's Netflix's business model. I have binged since treatment, but more important, I have stopped the binge and recovered from it. I have binged and not restricted the next day. It's so easy to give in to the ""might as well just keep going"" mentality. That kind of thinking kept me sick for 25 years. That's what I tell Kristen: You can pull yourself out of a tailspin. 
Thursday, March 19 
Everyone seems on edge, and texts fill my phone. My sister asks if I'm okay, because my ""posts seem angsty."" I reply: ""I'm fine! I'm dancing and foam rolling and having fun. This is how I cope."" I get caught in a crossfire of colleagues who have different ideas about teamwork in these strange times. I just want to help, but I feel my boundaries are being tested with every text. A close friend calls me codependent for my efforts to pitch in, and that hits the exposed nerve: Of course I'm codependent. We all are now! 
I take the dog on a late-afternoon stroll and leave the phone inside. I practice a grounding technique the writer Elizabeth Gilbert shared on Instagram, reminding followers to notice ""Five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can feel, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste."" The first thing I hear is a yappy dog. Laser and I quicken our pace; neither of us needs yapping. 
I get a text about President Trump. It feels like no one is in charge. This is what a big chunk of my childhood felt like until my eating disorder took the wheel. Even in treatment it sometimes felt that way. ""Why don't we have enough Greek yogurt or flaxseed?"" ""Why did the nutritionist undercook the soup on her last day?"" Things don't always go according to plan; I get it. But nothing feels like it's going according to plan now. I need to talk about my feelings. 
I resist the temptation to go to bed without dinner, but I do give in to comfort food: tuna fish salad and Club crackers. I know it's not the best meal, but I'm too exhausted to do more . 
Friday, March 20 
I wake up to texts from Kroger, loaded with items unavailable for delivery. I call Mom before I'm out of bed. She 's full of gratitude, assures me what's coming is enough, but I don't believe her. 
I put on running clothes, and as I take off, I realize how often I run scared - scared of not going far enough, scared of hurting myself. Today I let go of that. It feels good to not be scared in this scary time. I unclench my muscles and exhale, letting my gut fully expand. I say hi to every neighbor I pass. I feel inspired and look forward to getting home.

Mike the trainer appears on video chat to announce: ""I can't believe how much food I can eat in one day. I think I was meant to be fat."" 
The phone rings. Another friend has hit his edge: a new puppy in the house, an expanded job description, no friends nearby, his mother out shopping and a cabinet full of his favorite wine. He gets another call from another friend coming over to help. My stomach growls, and I think about dinner - not what I should eat, but what I want to eat, what my body, not my brain, wants in it. 
Saturday, March 21 
Saturday is my big run day, even though I've cut my miles way down. But didn't I run yesterday? Now I'm uncertain. I don't want to count this day as a No Day, a sort of sad snow day when I don't trust myself to do anything but lie in bed. 
I find a high-intensity interval training workout on a trainer's Instagram page. The lunges and squats and staying still are hard. I'm not used to slowing down, and I feel weak. All I want to do is run. But I stay. It ends with a virtual boxing class. The exhortations of this trainer, shouting encouragements to those of us on the live feed, speak to the me who loved to be in the front row of every step-aerobics class, whooping and hollering like I was in some kind of holy-rollers church. 
I call my neighbor Sybil, whose brother died this week. She gushes about the gifts showing up on her porch, thanks to a group text with other neighbors. ""Do you want some candy? I have so much ,"" she says. ""No, silly, I gave you that candy,"" I tell her. Why are we all trying to give away the sweetness others want for us? 
On a walk with Laser, I pick up some rocks to paint. Yes, this is what it's come to . A few nights ago, I flipped through a book I got in treatment, ""A Book That Takes Its Time: An Unhurried Adventure in Creative Mindfulness."" It has a lesson in rock painting. When I get home I show Robert the rocks, and he orders acrylic pens. 
While I was gone, a book I ordered from a local bookstore on Day 2 of self- isolation - knowing I'd need encouragement from another survivor - arrived. The book is about the author's struggles with bulimia and alcoholism and how she finally let herself out of the cage of being "" a good girl."" I open ""Untamed"" by Glennon Doyle to the page she 'd signed in advance as part of a book tour that she had to cancel because of the coronavirus pandemic. A quote fills the page: ""What would you do if you trusted yourself?""

100,INSIGHTS FROM LIVES OF SOLITUDE,"SAUK RAPIDS, MINN. - The Poor Clare Sisters know all about sheltering in place. 
They've been doing it most of their lives . 
Sixteen Catholic nuns reside at Saint Clare's Monastery in this central Minnesota city, living lives of service to God through prayer. To the usual vows of poverty, obedience and chastity, they've added one more: enclosure. 
From their hilltop sanctuary, they send out prayers in answer to the thousands of requests that come in by phone, by letter or confided through a screen in the doorway of their monastery. 
But they never leave their cloister, except for infrequent medical checkups. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads across Minnesota and much of the globe, several sisters graciously consented to meet and offer their thoughts on how the rest of us can cope with our social isolation during the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
""We are very happy and content, and feel very blessed to be in this situation. The Lord is very close to us,"" said Mother Marie Immaculata, the abbess of the monastery, who's lived here for 39 years. 
As for the rest of us, she said, ""You have quite a challenge out there. You have the opportunity to be in the world and live your lives as good people. 
""It's not hopeless.""

2/3/23, 2:03 PM INSIGHTS FROM LIVES OF SOLITUDE - ProQuest 
Here are some of the nuns' thoughts on keeping spiritually and emotionally healthy during a time of solitude . 
Stick to a program. ""It is very helpful to have a schedule to live by,"" said Mother Immaculata. The Poor Clare Sisters have regular times set aside daily for communal prayers, individual prayers, chapel, meals and relaxation. 
Be helpful. ""Do something for someone else,"" said Sister Mary Matthew, who's lived in the monastery for 36 years. ""Write a letter. Check on someone. Reach out to the elderly. Anyone can do that."" 
Enjoy yourself. ""Play some table games. Make some popcorn,"" said Mother Mary Barbara, the vicaress and a 27-year resident. The nuns gather every day for an hour to talk and relax. They might knit, crochet or make rosaries. Occasionally, they also enjoy pinochle, canasta, jigsaw puzzles and board games. Rack-O is a favorite. 
Make a joyful noise. ""The Sound of Music"" and ""The Singing Nun,"" it appears, are true to life . ""We do a lot of singing in our services,"" said Sister Mary Matthew. ""I encourage people to sing and listen to music. Those are the things that lift our hearts to God."" 
Live in the moment. ""Stop and smell the roses. Watch the grass grow. Focus on the goodness of God,"" said Mother Immaculata. 
The nuns have no radio, TV or internet. They do read St. Cloud or Twin Cities newspapers dropped off for them by local residents, so they have knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's all part of God's plan, they say, and they've seen good come from it. 
""We had a letter from a grandma,"" said Mother Mary Barbara. ""She was so happy that she could teach her granddaughters to crochet. In another letter, a little 4-year-old is calling this 'party days' because mom and dad are home and they can do all kinds of fun things."" 
And the nuns are praying for all of us. They've added multiple daily communal prayers for the end of the virus, and for those affected physically, emotionally and financially, said Sister Mary Christiana, a 17-year resident. 
""Our country is very generous,"" said Sister Mary Matthew. ""Where there is a crisis, goodness comes out. It's the face of God, the face of love."" 
Mother Mary Barbara said she's grateful that people are being so cooperative in abiding by the rules created for safety. It would have been easy, she said, for there to be ""a lot of rebellion and people objecting and not cooperating."" 
""So much beauty is coming from this,"" said Sister Mary Christiana. 
""People might be blaming God,"" said Sister Marie Elizabeth, cloistered for 23 years. ""God is all love and all good. He can't produce anything bad."" 
And that leads to the sisters' final tip: Remember that love has no barriers. 
""There's still that love and presence,"" Mother Immaculata said, ""even at a distance.""",4/27/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,neither,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1
103,Ramadan in a time of coronavirus; The solitude of social distancing gives the faithful time to reflect on Ramadan's core principles.,"The harira soup was flavored with lamb, the bread was freshly baked, and the dates were sweet as molasses, but what I remember most was the warmth of my parents and siblings around me. In Morocco, as elsewhere in the Muslim world, Ramadan was a time for community. For 30 days, no matter what obligations awaited, my family gathered around the table at sunset, waiting for the muezzin's call, which signaled the end of the fast. Then, after the iftar meal, it was time to call on friends and neighbors or go to mosque for taraweeh prayers. 
After I left home for college and moved to the United States, these childhood memories grew more precious, enhanced as they were by nostalgia. Ramadan remained my favorite holiday, celebrated without fail everywhere I've lived. With the spread of the coronavirus , however, the holy month will be unlike any I have ever known. Stay-at-home orders have been imposed around the world. Mosques in many states, including here in California, are closed. There will be no congregational prayers, no visits to family and no nighttime festivities. 
Still, this extraordinary time has something to teach us, if only we let it. The solitude that social distancing has suddenly forced upon the faithful gives us an opportunity to reflect on the core principles of Ramadan . According to Islamic tradition, it was during Ramadan that the prophet Muhammad received his spiritual revelation, in the form of the Quran. 
It is a month of daily fasting, prayer and reflection, though these are often matched by nightly banqueting, social mingling and partying. Not this year, of course. But freed of its ostentatious parts, Ramadan can better reveal the value of abnegation, charity and solidarity.

Fasting from dawn to dusk gives Muslims the chance to experience in the flesh the deprivation that the needy endure every day. Hunger is a compelling teacher. This year, I have donated more to food pantries, which have been overwhelmed with demand since schools and businesses were shuttered. With unemployment reaching levels not seen since the Great Depression, food pantries will continue to need donations in the months ahead. 
Being confined in my home all day has also renewed my commitment to end the cash bail system. Every year in this country, tens of thousands of people are locked up in jail not because they have been convicted of a crime, but because they cannot afford to pay their bail while they wait for their cases to be heard. A bail-fund contribution was already on my charity list, but with the spread of a highly infectious virus it was even more urgent. 
And while the quarantine prevents me from hosting elaborate iftars with family and friends, spending so much time with my husband and daughter has been enriching in other ways. It has given me the chance to reflect on the migrants and refugees who were separated from their children at the border. Since the president's family separation policy was enacted in 2018, their stories have slowly faded from the headlines. 
Aside from donating to various relief agencies, I've also found myself looking for ways to express my gratitude to those who risk their lives to make sheltering in place possible for the rest of us -- grocery store clerks, truck drivers, delivery workers, mail carriers, healthcare workers, among many others. These may be small gestures, like posting a thank you note on my door or leaving a generous tip through a delivery app, but they are what I can do while maintaining safe physical distancing . 
The biggest challenge for me is to remain hopeful in the face of devastation. More than 53,000 Americans are dead and tens of millions have lost their livelihoods. Meanwhile, the president muses about injecting disinfectant and, as usual, rails against the press. But here too, the holy month has been a salve, as it has reminded me that ""with every hardship, there is relief."" (Quran, 94:6.) 
""Have you ever experienced anything like this?"" I asked my father, who turned 83 years old recently. ""Never,"" he replied. 
In Morocco, where he and my mother live, quarantine restrictions are far more stringent than those in California, where I live. Only one person can leave the house to do the groceries, and they must carry a laissez-passer that can be checked by the police. There is a curfew in place after 7 p.m.

105,PERSPECTIVES; The psychological toll of isolation; The effects on mental health can be dire and lasting. But we might also become more resilient in long run.,"When 13 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship arrived in Nebraska in mid-February, David Cates was determined to make their mandatory stay as pleasant as possible. 
The passengers were among the first Americans known to be exposed to the coronavirus and had been ordered to remain isolated at a national quarantine center at the University of Nebraska Medical Center for at least two weeks, or until they no longer tested positive for the disease. Some would spend more than a month at the center before returning home. 
As a psychologist and behavioral health consultant for the quarantine center, it was Cates' job to tend to their emotional well-being while they remained isolated from friends and family in the outside world. He convened a daily ""town hall"" meeting via teleconference so those in isolation could ask doctors questions about the virus, give nurses feedback on the food they were served and talk to case workers about tracking down their luggage and booking flights home. 
He also taught them coping techniques such as meditation, deep breathing and cultivating gratitude to help them build resilience. 
Months later, he is still receiving thank-you notes. 
""What we were doing was giving them as much control over their lives and environment as possible,"" Cates said. ""If the story had ended there, it would have been great. Instead, we are in a global pandemic, and now we have to take care of everybody.""

2/3/23, 2:25 PM PERSPECTIVES; The psychological toll of isolation; The effects on mental health can be dire and lasting. But we might also become more resili… 
As millions of Americans face their second month of stay-at-home orders, scientists and health officials increasingly fear that physical distancing could take a grave toll on our collective mental health . 
Research suggests that people forced to live in quarantine conditions face a greater risk of anxiety, depression, anger, irritability, insomnia and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The longer a quarantine lasts, the worse its impact on psychological well-being. 
""There is no doubt that restrictive stay-at-home measures have been quite isolating for people, and all the more for people who are already isolated and vulnerable,"" said Dr. Michael J. Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program. 
But stopping the virus must come first, he said. 
""It is not easy, but it is something we must endure until we have in place other measures to suppress this disease,"" he said. 
To help officials manage the mental health repercussions of long -term physical distancing, researchers at King's College London published a review of scientific studies on the psychological impacts of quarantine, including ones implemented to counter the spread of Ebola, SARS, MERS and H1N1 influenza. 
The authors found that the key stressors that lead to psychological distress include boredom, frustration, inadequate supplies, limited information and financial loss, and that these effects can linger long after life returns to normal. For instance, one of the studies found that among hospital workers, being quarantined was a predictor of post-traumatic stress symptoms even three years after the isolation ended. 
The findings suggest a few ways officials can mitigate the psychological impact of quarantine: Keep the isolation as short as possible, ensure those in quarantine know why they must stay isolated, thank them for their sacrifice, and make sure everyone has access to the supplies they need. 
It is also essential that people can stay in touch with others. ""An inability to do so is associated not just with immediate anxiety, but longer-term distress,"" they wrote. 
Steve Cole, a UCLA researcher who studies the physiological effects of loneliness, said actively seeking social connection is essential to staying not only emotionally healthy but physically healthy as people isolate from one another. 
In his own work, he's found that feelings of loneliness trigger the body's immune system to increase its inflammatory response. That response is useful for fighting off bacterial infections, but it also creates what he calls a ""fertilizer"" for other diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease. (As it happens, some patients with severe cases of COVID-19 suffer not just from the virus' attack on the lungs but from an overactive inflammatory response.) 
This may explain why previous studies have found that people with strong social relationships are 50% more likely to be alive at the end of a study period compared with those with poor or insufficient social relationships. In fact, this research suggests that loneliness is as dangerous to your health as smoking, and even worse than obesity.

2/3/23, 2:25 PM PERSPECTIVES; The psychological toll of isolation; The effects on mental health can be dire and lasting. But we might also become more resili… 
Cole said the connection between loneliness and inflammation may have developed thousands of years ago when being alone would have made our ancestors more vulnerable to an attack by a saber-toothed tiger or made it more difficult to recover from an accident, like being injured by a falling branch. 
""This program in our body was set up for a world we no longer inhabit,"" he said. 
The good news is that our current state of physical isolation does not have to lead to loneliness, he said. 
""With social support, you can interrupt a lot of that threat-related physiology,"" he said. ""Staying connected to purpose and meaning in your life is the single most powerful resilience against that impact."" 
Dr. Jay Buckey, a former NASA astronaut who now works at the Dartmouth Geisel College of Medicine, has spent the last decade developing an online tool to help people manage the psychological fallout from a different type of isolation : the stress, depression and interpersonal conflict that can occur on a long -term spaceflight. 
""Living in isolation and confinement with a small number of people for a long time is a psychological challenge,"" he said. 
That's something billions of people have been learning first-hand on Earth. 
Buckey's experience with astronauts suggests that many of the issues that emerge in isolation are sharper versions of the problems we experience in daily life. 
""Maybe you were already stressed about something, but you had outlets that were working for you, and now you are cut off from them,"" he said. 
The tool he created, called PATH, is designed to help users manage difficult emotions. Based on behavioral therapy, it helps people look clearly at how they are thinking about a situation and understand how that thinking influences the actions they take. (Though designed for astronauts, PATH is available for free to the Earth-bound public as well.) 
Another analog for our current state can be found in the experience of those who spent time in the Antarctic with a small group of people for a long period, said Larry Palinkas, a professor at the School of Social Work at USC. 
Palinkas' work on the mental health of polar trekkers and those who live in research stations has revealed that one of the hallmarks of adapting to isolation and confinement is a willingness to let go of control. 
""You have to be flexible,"" he said. ""If you are highly demanding of yourself and others, you are going to have a harder time."" 
He also found that people tend to be able to manage the first half of their isolation -- whether it lasts for two weeks or two years -- but when they reach the halfway point, their resolve dips. 
""In the first half you conserve your emotional resources, engage in active forms of coping, and you do well,"" he said. ""In the second half, people often experience a letdown.""

2/3/23, 2:25 PM PERSPECTIVES; The psychological toll of isolation; The effects on mental health can be dire and lasting. But we might also become more resili… 
One of the profound challenges of our current situation is that no one knows when it will end. "" The fear is that our emotional resources will become depleted and we will become physically and mentally exhausted,"" he said. 
However, living through isolation can have a positive outcome as well, Palinkas said. It's known as salutogenesis, and it's the reward that comes from coping with stress and being more self-sufficient. 
In one of his early studies, he found that Navy personnel assigned to the Arctic in the 1950s, '60s and '70s had fewer hospital admissions and mental health problems when they returned home. 
""The idea is if you can survive an experience like this,"" he said, ""it results in a sense of accomplishment and a feeling like, 'I can handle anything.'""

It was long overdue, the apology phone call. The last time the Frolkis sisters, Talia and Liza, had exchanged any words was July 2019. And that conversation had ended on, well, less than good terms. 
Not that Talia, 32, the younger sibling, a biomedical scientist in Madison, Wis., can say exactly what the tiff was about. ""Who can remember the specifics?"" she said. ""There's always some dramatic thing happening with family. Something was going on in her life and I was as supportive as I could be, and I was exhausted and hoping for some gratitude. When it didn't come, I got a little snippy and it started a huge fight."" 
Nine months swept by with neither one making a move toward reconciliation -- the longest the two women had gone without speaking. And then the coronavirus hit, and the tectonic plates shifted in Liza Frolkis's psyche. 
""I missed her,"" said Liza, 37, who lives in Milwaukee. ""The weirdness of this time let me put aside the pain I was feeling. It gave me some perspective."" 
So she picked up the phone, old-school style , called her sister and said: ""This world is crazy. It's ridiculous that I haven't apologized to you."" 
And then, said Talia, ""I apologized back to her.""

With more than three million cases of Covid-19 worldwide and over 200,000 deaths, with huge numbers of people coming face to face with their own mortality or the mortality of someone they know, some individuals are excavating their pasts and reaching out to those they once knew and fell out with. Sometimes it's just to say hi, other times they're hoping for détente, and other times they want to mend a fence, or at least patch it with duct tape. 
""Covid has made us re-evaluate our priorities, and once hard liners are no longer important,"" said Pam Gillespie Blanton, 59, of Austin, Texas, who recently spoke with her nephew after a six-year estrangement. ""Going back to simpler, basic things. Talking, cooking, learning how to communicate."" 
Sometimes they're clearing their own conscience, like Ginny Roberts, 63, who lives in the Rockaway Beach neighborhood of Queens and who had been harboring serious resentment toward the woman who did the flowers for her wedding 17 years ago. 
The roses and dahlias cost Ms. Roberts $3,000, she said, and looked as if they'd been churned in a NutriBullet. The florist, who knew the family socially, had been leaving voice mail messages over the years, but Ms. Roberts avoided them. Finally, she decided the time was right to make amends. 
""I don't want to go to my grave being pissed about flowers, especially when they were for a marriage that isn't even intact anymore,"" Ms. Roberts said. ""I'm not sure if she knew I was angry all these years, but I needed to fix it. I feel like I buried the hatchet."" (At least the one she imagined.) 
Others feel emboldened to say things they never could before. Abigail P., 45, who works in insurance in Auburn Hills, Mich. -- and who asked that her last name not be used because it's awkward to discuss terrible ex-boyfriends in a newspaper -- said she recently had a ""vivid"" dream about an ex from 20 years ago. The relationship, which lasted about two years, ended ""pretty horribly,"" leaving her with some major scars. 
During an inventory of her romantic past over the last few weeks, though, she realized ""that I have fond memories of our time together and that I had forgiven him,"" she said. 
Abigail reached out to tell him that she was happy that he seemed so happy (thank you, LinkedIn). She said, ""Maybe that was more for me than him, but I'm glad I did it."" 
She also got a surprise of her own. He wrote back. 
""He said some kind things about me,"" she said. ""Considering how things ended, I'd always assumed he didn't think that highly of me."" 
Jorge Fagundo, a 41-year-old resident of Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, worried about that too when he contacted Carmen Lis Arcelay after nine years of silence. 
About a decade ago, Mr. Fagundo had been severely depressed and was having a hard time keeping a job. So Ms. Arcelay, then his close friend, invited him to stay with her and her husband on the island of St. Thomas for a few weeks. 
The few weeks turned into three months, and Ms. Arcelay and her husband were exasperated. ""I felt that he wasn't really contributing to the house,"" said Ms. Arcelay, 44, who works at a brewery in Ashburn, Va. ""We were driving him everywhere -- it became a hassle.""

2/3/23, 2:28 PM A Time for Isolation, Reflection and Burying the Hatchet: [Style Desk] - ProQuest She asked him to leave, but said he could temporarily move into the home she owned in Puerto Rico. There, he began growing marijuana on the roof. The Arcelays were livid and the friendship was ruined. ""My husband works for the government,"" she said. ""He could have gotten into a lot of trouble."" 
About a week and a half ago, Ms. Arcelay received an email from Mr. Fagundo. He had been working up the nerve to contact them, he said, and he understood he betrayed their trust and wanted them to know he was sorry. He left a phone number, and Ms. Arcelay called. They spoke for two hours. 
""Everybody makes mistakes,"" she said. ""We become different people in time . I really appreciated that he understood that what he did was wrong."" 
Mr. Fagundo acknowledged in an email that the pandemic influenced his decision to contact his friends, along with a heart attack he suffered about eight months ago that left him in the hospital for 55 days, and in a coma for 22 of them. 
""They say that a near-death experience can change who you are,"" he wrote. ""I don't know about that, but from my experience what it does is give you time to think and not only think but analyze and question almost everything. I have always been a loner and never thought I needed people at my side until now, and the urge to contact Carmen and Joel was even more significant at this moment."" 
This doesn't surprise those who are familiar with the social psychology of health crises. The end of life -- or what could be the end of life, even if not yours -- ""is when you want to put things to rest and express gratitude to people,"" said Margaret Moore, the founder of Wellcoaches, a company that trains professional health care coaches. 
""We want to clean things up,"" Ms. Moore said. ""I think it's a very good thing if the virus is prompting people to repair old relationships. That's a sign of deepening the meaning of this."" 
Abigail P. also felt a powerful urge to seek repair. ""In this case, my choice of closure was allowing myself to forgive him. And he deserved that, even if I never had the chance to tell him directly,"" she said, adding that she doesn't want to reconcile with her ex. 
""My intent was not to push my way back into his life,"" she said. ""It was healing enough just to let him know that I after all these years, I can smile in remembering the good times we shared.""",4/30/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3

* ""I actually met someone right before the governor put out the mandatory stay-at-home order. We met on Tinder the day before, both of us tired of dating , wanting something serious. I would say the big difference is usually I would have a few dates [with different guys] lined up, but with the quarantine, it forces you to spend time getting to know the first person you met, especially if you were already vibing on the first date rather than 'See what your options are.' I've seen him in ways I wouldn't have this early on in dating . This pandemic has exposed people's character in ways I think I would have never known but would have had to guess. 'How emotionally stable are you? How do you deal with the challenges of life?'""

For the past month, we've texted every day and FaceTimed sometimes. But this feels different from my other Tinder situationships. Do I feel pressured in the age of COVID-19 to avoid feeling lonely at all costs? Would our physical chemistry hold up? Will this actually be unlike my other Tinder escapades?

110,"EPIPHANY OUT OF EPIDEMIC; IN TOUGH TIMES AND TIGHT SPACES, OUR TRUE COLORS SHINE THROUGH, WHETHER WE'RE ALONE OR TOGETHE","All this time at home has a side effect: a chance to learn more about ourselves and the people quarantining with us. 
The coronavirus shutdown has upended most of our daily routines. Most of the things that were keeping us occupied suddenly ceased to exist. Commutes are canceled. So are our social lives. Suddenly, those of us who aren't essential workers are spending almost all of our time at home. This has created opportunities for self-discovery: being able to look inward and learn new things about yourself. 
For some, the stay-at-home orders became an opportunity to get to know both themselves and their partners in a new way. For others, it was a chance to be truly together for the first time . 
Faith Colburn and Lauren Pulido were going to take it slow. The longtime friends had just admitted in late February that they had feelings for each other. 
Pulido had broken up with his girlfriend and moved home to a duplex he shares with his mom and grandmother in Sacramento two weeks earlier. They wanted to feel out this new phase, go on dates, be together in a romantic way for the first time . 
""We're like, let's not jump into this. I don't feel a need to rush,"" Colburn said. 
The same afternoon they had that conversation about taking it slow, the stay-at-home orders were issued. It was a Friday. Starting Monday, they wouldn't be able to see each other.

2/3/23, 2:35 PM EPIPHANY OUT OF EPIDEMIC; IN TOUGH TIMES AND TIGHT SPACES, OUR TRUE COLORS SHINE THROUGH, WHETHER WE'RE… 
They made a snap decision: Never mind taking it slow. Let's quarantine together. 
Colburn packed her things and moved into the duplex with Pulido's family, which also includes two dogs and a cat. 
That was six weeks ago. Now, they're navigating changes at work -- both work for the state government-- on top of the major change in their personal lives. It's been an unprecedented chance to get to know each other in new ways. 
""Something I already knew but was confirmed is how fundamentally kind he is,"" Colburn said. ""I've seen his heart."" Pulido, who knew Colburn for her ""strong, independent"" streak, is learning about a different side, a softer one, especially as he has started taking testosterone in February as part of the hormonal transitioning process. ""Faith has been such a great supporter in allowing me space to find myself during this whole experience."" 
Obviously not everyone will fall deeply, madly in love with their best friend during quarantine. But it's not only new couples who are learning things about each other. 
Steve Adams and his wife, Rebekah, celebrated their 37th wedding anniversary this week. 
He works as a triage nurse at the Keck Hospital of USC, which means he's still going in to work. His wife is a consultant for the funeral industry and is able to do her job from their home in Pacoima. Normally, they spend weekends going to bars and restaurants and sporting events with friends; quarantine has forced them to spend more time on domestic pursuits. He said even after almost four decades together, they can still surprise each other -- and themselves. 
""I always knew she had it in her, but she's discovered she can cook and actually cook pretty well,"" he said. Prior to this, he usually volunteered to cook while she did dish duty. He said he's learned things about himself too, like that he enjoys doing art projects in the backyard. 
The key to quarantine success, he said: Treat your spouse like your teammate. 
""If you've ever played sports, don't be a jerk to your teammates. I think that applies to marriage too,"" he said. He's had excellent, if inadvertent, teachers on that front: ""My dad was married four times and my mom was married three times , so I learned a lot about what not to do in a marriage from my mom and dad."" 
Ryan Howes, a clinical psychologist in Pasadena, said he's seen his clients make breakthroughs during this shutdown time : Self-described introverts realize how much they rely on socializing, while social butterflies enjoy their newfound quiet time . Finding ways to fill the extra time has also led to some joyful discoveries: Maybe you've found you love baking, gardening or watching obscure YouTube videos with your kid. 
If you haven't felt an inner ""a-ha"" moment yet, Howes said there are ways to help the process along. Guided meditation is a good way to look inward, as is keeping a journal. 
""It can be a few words or a 'Dear Diary' thing, but that is an excellent way for people to really clarify their thoughts and put them down in a way that they can understand and even look back on later, which I think is why people are really talking about journaling"" right now, Howes said. ""People really want a record of this.""

Revisiting old journals is one of the ways Vivi Le realized just how much she's changed. Le, a recent UCLA graduate who lives with her sister and mom in L.A.'s Chinatown neighborhood, said before the shutdown she was working multiple jobs while trying to get her acting career off the ground. Now, she has a chance to check in with herself and look through old diaries and photos from her teenage years. Back then, she would have described herself as self-confident, but her diary entries reveal someone full of anger, sadness and self-hatred. That's changed. 
""Now in quarantine, I'm more alone than I was in high school, I feel more happy, I'm full of hope and joy, and so much more optimism. It's made me realize how much I've grown,"" she said. ""Me at 19 would never believe I'd ever be able to feel this way."" 
She said both she and her mom, who was born and grew up during the Vietnam War, find themselves oddly prepared for this unique moment. She said America's go-go-go productivity culture gave her the chance to dream big about her life -- something she said she felt like her relatives in Vietnam never got -- but it also initially made her feel worthless for not being more ""productive"" during this time . She pushed past it and moved into a phase of gratitude for what she has. Her mom, meanwhile, had always kept lots of supplies like toilet paper and canned food on hand in anticipation of some big emergency that never seemed like it was going to happen -- until now. 
""I thought she was going to freak out more. She's seemed very anxiety-prone and waiting for something to happen, but when this happened she was so calm,"" Le said. ""She wasn't anxious at all. I think I understand why. She's been ready."" 
Some people have discovered this time is a chance to get to know the people they can't be with. Regina Chow Trammel is an associate professor of social work at Azusa Pacific University. Teaching over Zoom has created a chance to do something she's never been able to do: see inside the daily home lives of her students, many of whom she said are first- or second-generation Latinx immigrants. 
""I didn't realize that some of them were literally caring for siblings or even financially"" supporting them, she said. ""I've heard these stories, but it's another thing to see the activity in the home, to hear the background noise of their siblings talking to them or just what they were balancing. ... I think you know it intellectually, but when you experience something it goes deeper."" 
As a mindfulness researcher, she's used this time to check in with herself and come up with a new framework for what success looks like. Her teaching mantra has changed from pushing her students to work harder and achieve more to compassion and acceptance for where everyone is right now. That includes for herself: Things that she used to enjoy, like shopping for groceries at 99 Ranch, are now regimented and exhausting. She said she can't expect herself or her students to be at their most productive when day-to-day existence has become such a challenge. 
""Thriving is going to look different. I think we can flourish"" in new ways, she said. She offered a metaphor: We just have to treat ourselves like plants. 
""We need some sun, we need to breathe fresh air, we need a nap. That's the best we can do. Be like plants. Grow where you're planted. Drink lots of water. Bend towards the light.""",5/2/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,2,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
111,Eating disorders can be exacerbated by isolation: The pandemic has made dealing with eating disorders difficult. But there are positive trends.,"The coronavirus has made life more challenging for many of us. But the isolation and stress that seem to be part of the pandemic are hitting those with eating disorders particularly hard. 
""Eating disorders thrive in isolation ,"" said Jillian Lampert, chief strategy officer with the Emily Program. ""Particularly if you live by yourself, or if you're in a situation without a lot of social support, the eating disorder isolation messages or thoughts and feelings that people have get so intense."" 
Isolation has made the symptoms of the disorder -- restricting calories, binge eating , overexercising and purging food -- easier to go undetected. 
""You don't have to explain to anybody why you won't go out for pizza with them. Nobody's going out for pizza,"" said Lampert. ""You don't have to explain to anybody why you can 't be around for a meal, because you're not going anywhere for a meal,"" she said. ""For that part of it, people are at a much higher risk, because the isolating behaviors are really supported, in a way."" 
And the attendant stress can serve to exacerbate the mental health issues often coupled with eating disorders , such as anxiety, depression and substance abuse. 
In addition, the stay-at-home order has spawned concern about weight gain (the so-called COVID-15) and overeating while in quarantine.

2/3/23, 2:36 PM Eating disorders can be exacerbated by isolation: The pandemic has made dealing with eating disorders difficult. But there are positive trends. - Pr… 
Those messages can be triggers for people who struggle to maintain a healthy relationship with food, said Claire Mysko, CEO of the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA). 
""We are hearing, and seeing, and being exposed to a lot of messages about fear of weight gain -- influencers and companies capitalizing on this anxiety with messages about fitness and diet,"" Mysko said. ""And it's very harmful."" 
In part to combat those messages, NEDA has launched ""COVID-19 forum,"" an online chat, as well other resources to help during the pandemic . Mysko said NEDA's online chat resources have seen an increase in use. 
""In quarantine, and when people are at home, they're dealing with a lack of privacy. And so people are looking for ways to reach out that are , you know, more private and discreet,"" Mysko said. ""And so we've seen a spike in our chat volume as a result."" 
She and Lampert advised anyone who is struggling to reach out for support or offer it to a loved one. 
""It's a great opportunity to say, 'You know, I'm really, really struggling with this, can you sit down with me and have this meal?' Or, 'I'm going have the meal, can you play a game with me afterwards to keep me distracted?' "" Lampert said. 
Shira Charpentier, founder of the nonprofit Living Proof MN, which provides free support groups and one-on one mentoring, has had to discontinue the in-person meals she regularly hosts for people in her home. 
""When that stopped, a lot of people went downhill pretty quickly,"" she said. ""And then I got a lot of e-mails and texts, saying, 'My treatment center has closed or my therapist is online,' or, you know, 'The things that I used to do are unavailable. Now I really don't know how to get support and I feel just completely isolated.' "" 
'An odd silver lining' 
However, there are bright spots in eating disorder treatment. 
The increased access to telehealth makes it easier to get help, especially since there 's no need to leave home to have access to therapy. And insurers are more widely covering online appointments. 
In addition, some treatment programs are seeing a swelling of support and follow-through. 
Lampert said the Emily Program's family-based treatment programs are seeing progress, perhaps because people have more time to spend with their children. 
""There 's so much more opportunity for supervision and support, that this is a great time,"" she said. ""It's an odd silver lining."" 
While transitioning to online treatment has been complicated, the Melrose Center, another treatment facility, has seen an increase in calls for assessments and fewer no-shows and canceled appointments, said the center's clinical director, Heather Gallivan. 
COVID-19, and the challenges it brings with it, is likely to be with us for a while. That's why experts are urging people with eating disorders to do their best to take care of themselves.

113,Finding Some 'Alone Time' in a Crowded World: [Real Estate Desk],"With a little subterfuge, parents find ways to work or just stay sane in a car parked on the street, in a thrown-together basement office or downstairs next to the water heater. 
Every workday for the last six weeks, Rachel Kanarek Boudoin has gotten dressed, made breakfast for her daughters, who are ages 4 and 2, then kissed them goodbye before heading out into the garage. 
But Ms. Boudoin, a commercial real estate attorney, hasn't been driving to her office in downtown Atlanta the way she used to before the coronavirus arrived. Instead, she sneaks around her backyard to a basement entrance, and spends the next eight hours in an unfinished office that she and her husband hastily set up in mid-March. 
Ms. Boudoin, 40, began sheltering in place about a week before Atlanta's mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, issued a stay-at-home order on March 23. She now spends every workday in her ad hoc basement office, which she has since outfitted with a mini fridge and microwave. And at 5 p.m. every day, Ms. Boudin slips out of the office, opens her garage door once again, and walks back into her home. 
Ms. Boudin's daughters haven't caught on that their mother is in the basement all day while they stay upstairs with their father. Like millions of Americans sheltering with families as the coronavirus pandemic stretches into its second month, she has carved out a solution to maintain privacy and personal space in crowded quarters.

2/3/23, 2:38 PM Finding Some 'Alone Time' in a Crowded World: [Real Estate Desk] - ProQuest 
To not blow her cover, there are some complicated acrobatics. She turns off all of the lights in the office before using the microwave, so as not to trip a fuse. When her elder daughter spied her car in the driveway, she was told that mommy now takes Uber. And when nature calls, she texts her husband to ensure the coast is clear before dashing into the bathroom down the hall, lest her children be playing nearby and see her. 
""We have to very carefully plan my bathroom runs,"" she said with a laugh. ""I pee then run back into my basement bunker."" 
For working parents in smaller spaces, there have been even more creative solutions. 
Brianne Dashti, 38, lives with her husband, Noam, and their three young children in a 700-square-foot apartment in Tel Aviv. Also an attorney, she has resorted to working out of her husband's car each day, which is parked on the street below their building. She tosses aside children's' toys, sets up a mobile office and hammers away at her laptop until the computer's battery dies. 
If she needs Wi-Fi, she moves instead to the apartment's bathroom, sitting either on the ledge of the bathtub or on the stool her children use to brush their teeth. 
""I've been doing this for a few weeks now, so I'm always prepared and I carry snacks,"" she said. ""I have a mug of coffee, a bottle of water and lots of nuts and dried fruit in my backpack, whether I'm going to the car or the shower. And I tell my kids 'goodbye, mommy is going to work,' and my husband distracts them until I get set up."" 
Shower-stall offices and basement bunkers are a safeguard around personal space in this unprecedented time , said Dr. John Grohol, the founder of Psych Central, a mental health social network. They may seem extreme, but they also serve as a stand- in for aspects of our pre-Covid life. 
""When we go to work or school, it creates a boundary in relationships,"" he said. ""When you're thrown together in quarantine, you don't have that boundary anymore."" 
Previously forgotten corners and crannies of our homes are also getting new use, not just as home offices but also as refuges for ""me time "" and personal space. 
Roy Movshovitz, 35, an operations manager for Google, had only recently started taking advantage of the gym at the tech giant's Mountain View, Calif. headquarters when coronavirus took hold. Now quarantined at home in Belmont, Calif. with his wife, Tiffanie Wen, and their 2-year-old daughter, he didn't want to lose his fitness momentum. 
So he set up a mini gym in what he calls an unused crawl space alongside some of the basement mechanicals, ordering a mat, barbells and gym bench online and replicating the moves his personal trainer taught him. The space is sloped with an uneven ceiling, and Mr. Movshovitz, who stands 6 feet tall, has to slouch in all but one corner. Ms. Wen has also made use of the space, heading in there on her own schedule to explore a newfound hobby for painting. 
""When I go back to work I doubt I'll use the crawl space gym much,"" said Mr. Movshovitz. ""But Tiff, on the other hand, has a special connection to it now. She actually might stay there or go down there more often, even when this is over.""

And for many single parents, the solution is trading sleep for personal time . Christie Burrows, 37, is the mother of London, 14, and Olivia, 4; London lives with her full-time and Olivia splits time between her father's home and Ms. Burrow's home, both in San Diego. So Ms. Burrows, a health IT sales coordinator, wakes an hour earlier than the rest of her household to meditate and join zoom workout classes from her living room. 
""I have to get myself centered before the kids wake up,"" she said. ""I don't have any other down time anymore."" 
It's not just adults that need personal space, either. Amber Lombardi, 35, an oral health professional in Portland, Maine, has two children -- Olive, 10; and Harry, 12. Olive has high-functioning autism, so the transition to at-home learning has been particularly tough for her. So Ms. Lombardi and her husband took the doors off several of their home's closets, added sparkly curtains and twinkling lights, and created a series of cozy safe enclaves Olive can go to when she needs to be alone . 
""We're trying to help our children cope with something we're not even prepared to cope with,"" said Ms. Lombardi. ""When she asked if she could make a safe space in the closets, I said, 'go for it.""' 
No matter how we are repurposing corners of our homes, it's important to understand that the need for solitude is normal, said Dr. Grohol. The key is to ask our families for space if we need it.

114,Coping with isolation: Two experts on being very alone offer tips to stay healthy,"One of the best things we can all do during the COVID-19 pandemic is to practice social distancing and isolate ourselves. But as individuals, the side effects of isolation , especially with no end date in sight, can be devastating. 
A number of studies show that feelings of loneliness can cause significant health effects. The death rate is twice as high for people who lack social and community ties. In fact, one researcher says loneliness can be as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes each day. 
Of course those effects are the far end of the impact spectrum. But then there's this: Our brains process information more efficiently in the presence of other people than when we're alone . Phone calls and videochats help, but we also have to get comfortable with being alone . 
Add it all up, and isolation , while necessary right now, is also a problem. So how can you better deal with the repercussions of all that alone time? 
For answers, I went to two experts in spending time alone : Nicole Apelian and Zachary Fowler, both of whom were contestants on the History channel's ""Alone ."" 
The premise of ""Alone "" is simple: Drop contestants in a remote wilderness with limited gear, isolated from all human contact except for periodic medical check-ins, and see who lasts the longest. 
Which, because there's no way to know when the contest will end, only adds to the mental and emotional stress. (Sound familiar?) 
So how do you deal with the fact that no set end is in sight?

""The key is to stop obsessing over everything you can't control and just take it one thing at a time,"" Fowler says. ""Every time I did something, I finished something, I just did the next thing. Whenever I'm stuck, whenever I'm alone or frustrated. ... I just do the next thing."" 
Small, day-to -day goals that serve a larger goal help keep you motivated, and more importantly, feeling successful. Because feeling successful, in however small a way, always feels good. 
Apelian sees the lack of normal connections as an opportunity to make other connections, especially with nature. She has a ""sit spot,"" a place where she watches the birds, the deer and the change of seasons. 
""You can connect not just to robins,"" she says, ""but to a robin. I knew the bears on 'Alone .' I wanted to know what they were doing. I knew the eagle, the pair of kingfishers. That made me feel connected to their lives, and in a way, like they were connected to mine."" 
Apelian also tries to enjoy the gift of time losing its meaning. 
""If you find yourself with a little free time, let go of the need to be constantly productive and instead actively try to not think about what time it is. When I was in Mongolia, a man said to me, 'Every time one of you looks at a watch, the very next thing you do is rude,' because checking your watch means you just disconnected. Constantly checking the time takes you out of the present moment."" 
Fowler also recommends knowing your weak times. 
""At the end of the workday, people naturally start to miss the life that was their life,"" he says. ""If that happens to you, plan for it: Use that time to reach out, to call family or friends, or to find old friends. And if you can connect with someone who is tired and struggling and give them a kind word ... then you both win."" 
Bottom line: While your day-to -day has changed, you can still find a sense of meaning. According to Eckhart Tolle in the bestselling ""A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,"" the happiest people are those who live in the moment, with purpose. 
""When your options are limited,"" Apelian says, ""that can actually be a kind of gift, because it means you can live in the right now."" 
And use the time to do something you've been meaning to tackle. 
""Instead of complaining about what you've lost,"" Fowler says, ""focus on the opportunity you've gained to do what you've always said you wanted to do. Start that project. Learn that instrument. Get more disciplined and consistent with something you've always wanted to do."" 
As the Stoics would say, you can't control what happens to you. But you can control how you respond, and that sense of agency and purpose will help you better cope with feelings of isolation and loneliness.",5/4/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,9,6
119,"For elderly, pandemic forces them into 'cruel' isolation","It never occurred to Peter Stein he wouldn't be able to see his 5-year-old grandson. 
A retired sociologist in his 80s, Stein understood the scientific argument for social distancing. But he and his wife, Michele Murdock, still got emotional when their son and daughter-in-law broke the news that they wouldn't be able to see their grandson for months. 
""For older people, myself included, we don't know how long we have,"" Murdock said. ""It is a cruel event at this time in our lives."" 
Many older adults, who have a higher risk of a severe illness from the novel coronavirus, are facing this hard irony: Social distancing is especially important to stay safe - but it can be hard on emotional and even physical health. 
Research has shown that loneliness and social isolation can set off a host of negative health effects among older people. 
""Increased rates of cardiovascular disease, worsened diabetes, increased risk of dementia - the effects are pretty profound,"" said Carla Perissinotto, chief of geriatrics clinical programs at the University of California at San Francisco. ""If there's something that's keeping me up at night, it's this."" 
Even without pandemic -induced social distancing, older people often grow more isolated as they age, due to retirement from work, the loss of a spouse or other family members, and the death of longtime friends.
For elderly, pandemic forces them into 'cruel' isolation
Kristen Addison-Brown, a neuropsychologist in Jonesboro, Ark., who works mostly with older patients, said that for many seniors, regular interactions with the health-care system might be a large part of their social routine. 
With most nonessential medical care on hold, many older people have lost that. 
""All of the things that we recommend for good mental and physical health,"" Addison-Brown said, ""those are the very things that they can't do right now."" 
'A balancing act'  
Perissinotto has had a personal window into concerns about older people being isolated. 
Her mother, a widow, was living by herself in Santa Barbara, Calif., a more than five-hour drive away, when the pandemic began. 
She fell squarely in the demographic that experts on isolation and aging are most worried about as social distancing measures go into place. 
The family had a discussion: Was it better for Perissinotto's mom to come stay with her and her husband, which meant she would not be as socially isolated? Or was it better for her to stay where she was, with little or no interaction with others? 
After talking through the risks and benefits - including discussions about advanced care planning, and what the family would do if she, or another family member, got sick - they ended up deciding it was better to bring her mom to Perissinotto's house. 
""It's a balancing act,"" Perissinotto said. ""And I think what's not being talked about is how do you balance these risks [related to the pandemic ] and how do you balance well-being?"" 
Perissinotto says their choice might not be the best decision for every family. But there is evidence that having these sorts of discussions might actually help older people cope with their circumstances. 
""The idea of giving the older adults choices is key,"" said Louise Hawkley, a senior research scientist with NORC at the University of Chicago. 
She pointed to a study that was done in the 1970s in a nursing home that found some of the feelings of depression and even physical decline in older people might be attributable to lack of a sense of control. 
""We need to be hunkering down right now,"" Hawkley said. ""But within that context, no matter what state you're in, how strict those rules are, there is always some kind of choice you can make. What are you going to do with that circumstance now that you're in it and you have a choice?"" 
A technology solution 
For some older people, technology can be an important lifeline. 
Under normal circumstances, Stanice Anderson, 69, would have spent the spring speaking to groups about addiction and recovery, playing with her grandchildren and organizing dances at Capitol Hill Towers, the senior housing community in the District where she lives.
But the group gatherings have been canceled. Last month, her son came by to pick up his birthday present with her granddaughter in the car. Anderson put the present in the trunk, so they wouldn't have contact. 
""We were waving and crying from six feet away,"" she said. 
Yet she has learned to cope the same way many younger people have - via webcam. 
Anderson has started using Skype and FaceTime to talk to her son and grandchildren. ""It definitely helps,"" Anderson said. ""We're actually getting to see each other, talk to each other."" 
Hawkley said the technology solution to social isolation is a good one. She thinks this might be a moment when older people who have been reluctant to use technology may learn to appreciate its benefits. 
She added that older adults tend to use technology ""wisely"" - to stay connected to people they already have a strong connection with - rather than scrolling on Twitter or Instagram as younger adults might. 
Researchers said they hope that the awareness and concern for older people who are isolated will persist long after the pandemic eventually recedes. 
""We have younger adults right now experiencing some degree of social isolation that they find aversive,"" Hawkley said. ""And the reality is, this is an experience that older adults have been experiencing for some time, and it hasn't been given due regard. 
""It isn't just older adults who need other people, it isn't just younger adults who need other people,"" she said. ""We are social, we all need each other.""",5/12/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9
122,"How to Expand Your Quarantine Bubble; Tired of isolation, more people are seeing friends and extended family. There are ways to manage the risk.","With some businesses across the country welcoming customers again, the Hecker family of Grosse Pointe, Mich., is planning its own reopening. 
Sarah and Todd Hecker have been isolating at home with their two children, ages 8 and 10, since mid-March, except for trips to the grocery store and drugstore and walks in their neighborhood. But as soon as Michigan's stay-at-home order expires on May 28, the family will visit Ms. Hecker's parents and mother-in law, who live nearby. There will be no masks and no social distancing. 
""I want to hug my parents again,"" says Ms. Hecker, a 43-year-old political and nonprofit fundraiser and event planner. 
With many people isolating for more than two months now, the yearning to see friends and extended family is growing. The missed milestones—birthdays, anniversaries— are adding up. Many families are now grappling with whether, when and how to open their pandemic- quarantine bubbles to additional people . 
But while companies have received guidelines and safety recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and business organizations like the National Restaurant Association, families and individuals are mostly left to do their own reopening risk -benefit analyses alone. Some areas are still banning all nonessential gatherings. Most states provide only general guidelines for socializing, such as limiting gatherings to 10 people or fewer.

That leaves many families with unanswered questions: Who should we let in? Masks or no masks? And is it safe to visit Grandma? 
Thinking through risks 
Doctors say there are several factors to weigh as people contemplate their own reopenings, including how many cases of Covid-19 are in the area and whether those numbers are falling.

""People are going to have to be guided by what the situation is locally and who it is they are thinking about getting together with and what the individual risks may be in terms of people 's age and other health conditions,"" says Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ""If you're in a state that's opening up but the number of cases is still on the rise in that state, I would probably be a little less quick to start gathering with family and friends than in a state where the case rates were dropping significantly."" 
Public-health experts generally agree that to reopen society safety, communities need widespread testing so officials can be confident that the number of coronavirus cases is low and people who are positive can be isolated. They also need a system to trace people who have come into contact with positive cases, so they can be quarantined, too. 
""When I know people are getting tested and contacts are being traced, I'll feel a lot better about"" people opening up their social bubbles , says Donald K. Milton, professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. He notes that most communities in the U.S. still lack adequate testing and tracing. 
So, the safest course is to continue to adhere to social-distancing protocols when visiting with people outside your household. That means that everyone wears masks and stays at least 6 feet apart from each other. 
""States and companies ending stay-at-home orders doesn't mean we should stop social distancing,"" says Andrew Janowski, an instructor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""Unfortunately, this is going to be the new norm. When we have a vaccine is when we can start relaxing these aspects. That is so far off at this point."" 
But that may not be palatable for some . Doctors say that if you do decide to ease up on social distancing, there are ways to mitigate the risks . Avoid ""hugging and kissing, as hard as that may be,"" says Dr. Kuritzkes. 
Everyone should be diligent about ""hand hygiene,"" washing their hands for at least 20 seconds and not touching their faces to avoid ""transmission from shared utensils or everybody dipping into the same dish of guacamole,"" he says.

And avoid packing people into small spaces. "" The more intimate the setting, the smaller number of people who should be getting together because of the risks of greater likelihood of transmission,"" he says. Also, outdoor gatherings are safer than meeting up indoors, since there is more ventilation and air flow, which dilutes the number of virus particles per volume of air. 
Expanding the bubble 
Scott and Lisa Burkhart, 67 and 64 years old, have been quarantining in their home in Livermore, Calif., since March 21, only making trips to the grocery store and Home Depot and seeing one other couple in their neighborhood. But they are planning a trip to Seattle this weekend to visit their three grown children and their families , including three grandchildren all less than a year old. ( The Burkharts will be flying to Seattle in the small plane they own.) 
""We'll risk being a little more exposed just to make sure to be a part of their lives,"" says Mr. Burkhart, who owns a grape farm. Two of their children have continued to work on-site at their respective jobs, raising the potential exposure, but Mr. Burkhart says he's more comfortable widening his circle now. 
""We certainly want to avoid catching [Covid-19], but we're not going to lock ourselves up for 18 months to make sure that happens,"" he says. Except for socially distanced outdoor meetups, he and his wife have no plans to expand their social circle any further. 
Dr. Milton suggests that people still ""keep their contact bubble as small as possible. The more people going to work, going to the grocery store, there 's more opportunity to bring things into the bubble , and more people in the bubble to get infected."" 
What if a few families who have truly been isolating want to join together, promising only to socialize with each other? Dr. Janowski says that while this is ""low risk , it is not zero."" 
Dr. Kuritzkes notes that some research has found that people are most contagious in the two or so days before they exhibit symptoms of Covid-19. And some people never show symptoms but can still transmit the disease. 
""Until we know that in the community the rates are really very low, then there is going to be that risk ,"" Dr. Kuritzkes says. Older people and those with underlying health conditions are more likely to become seriously ill or die from Covid-19. So, they and their families and friends need to be much more cautious about widening their social circles, doctors say. 
Sometimes it is the children driving the open-up decision. After nearly two months in lockdown with his parents and brother, 12-year-old Grayson Lalumiere had had enough. ""It was boring, and I missed my friends ,"" says Grayson, who lives in Fairfield, Conn. 
He wanted to join some neighbor children who were out riding bikes together, like they had often done prepandemic. But his mother, Brooke Lalumiere, said no. ""I'm sorry I'm not there yet,"" she told him. 
So, Grayson and his buddies came up with a proposal via text messages and presented it to their parents: The boys promised to wear masks and stay 6 feet apart from each other if they could ride their bikes together around town. Ms. Lalumiere says she could see how the isolation and lack of independence were

taking a toll on her son. Grayson ""had a few kind of sad moments, he just wanted to know, 'When can I see my friends ?' "" she says. The parents agreed to the new plan. 
The first day, Ms. Lalumiere drove by the park where the boys congregated to make sure the children were wearing their masks. ""A little healthy fear is good. If you know mom is going to drive by at any minute, you are going to keep the thing on,"" says Ms. Lalumiere, a 41-year-old jewelry designer. 
Now, Grayson and his friends ride almost every day. ""We explore random places and talk about school, how it's kind of boring but it's easy,"" he says of his online sixth-grade classes. In recent days, the boys have earned new privileges: They are allowed to buy snacks at the local bagel shop and Mobil station. ( The parents' rules: Masks and gloves are required.) 
Ms. Lalumiere says the rides have brightened Grayson's mood. 
""He's content again,"" she says. 
Tiptoeing around 
Family members don't always agree on reopening plans. So, some people are opening up and not admitting it. Lorraine Durkin, 72, and her husband hadn't been visiting friends ' houses or having anyone over to their Pittston, Pa., condominium since Covid-19 cases surged and their state's stay-at-home order came down on April 1. But two weeks ago, the couple had an electrician and craftsman over to install lighting and tilework in their home. ""They were all over the house,"" says Ms. Durkin, who says the men spent five days working in her home. ""I just stayed 6 feet away from them."" 
Ms. Durkin says she was careful not to reveal the presence of the visitors to her grown children before or during the work. ""I would have been chastised,"" she says. ""I just don't need the grief."" 
(She says she did finally tell her children recently, and they weren't upset.) 
If you do decide to have a housekeeper or repair person work in your home, ""limit it to when it is absolutely necessary,"" says Purvi Parikh, an immunologist at NYU Langone Health in New York. ""Anytime you invite anyone into your home, there is a risk ."" She also recommends asking them to wear masks and gloves. And if you can, leave the house while they are working, which will help ""limit exposure to the respiratory droplets,"" Dr. Parikh says. 
The Hecker family in Michigan has a multiphase plan for their reopening. Ms. Hecker's parents and mother in-law are in Phase 1, she says. If all goes well and there isn't another wave of cases, Ms. Hecker says Phase 2 will involve adding two neighbor children to their circle this summer. That way , her children will have playmates during the long days with no online school or their usual swim team practices. 
""We'll put up the sprinkler or get a small pool,"" says Ms. Hecker. ""We'll figure out a way [the children] can play together.""",5/14/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,8
126,MINNSPIRATIONS: CYBER-SENIORS COMBATS ISOLATION,"Reese Michaelson, Tim Whisler, Isaac Rinkleff-Duma and Nayan Narula -- all students at Southwest High School in Minneapolis -- were regular visitors to The Waters on 50th, a senior living community in Minneapolis. The tech-savvy teens mentored older adult residents eager to learn how to send e-mails, share on Facebook and text the grandkids. 
Not even COVID-19 could stop this special partnership. 
But now the four teens mentor remotely, by phone, video calls and group webinars. They're volunteers with Cyber-Seniors , a nonprofit that connects tech-literate teens with seniors to help them understand and use technology. 
""We grew up with it. They didn't. So it only seems fair for us to help,"" said Michaelson, who was recently appointed to the Cyber-Seniors Teen Leadership Council, which works with teens across North America. 
Cyber-Seniors program manager Beth S. Winnick said the teens' role has become ever more vital during the current health crisis. 
""Not to be dramatic,"" said Winnick, ""[but] it's a matter of life and death to help isolated seniors."" Citing a study published on WebMD, she noted that ""loneliness has the same impact on mortality as smoking 15 
cigarettes per day, meaning it's more dangerous than obesity. 
""It's important for seniors to be able to connect with friends and family, order medications and groceries, find news and entertainment and get access to medical information online.""
The outreach, which began as a high school project in Toronto, has been active in the Twin Cities for several years. Before COVID-19, Cyber-Seniors offered in-person help at Linden Hills Library in Minneapolis and the Keystone Best Buy Teen Tech Center in St. Paul. 
During the pandemic, older adults can sign up for free educational group video webinars on how to place a video call or listen to podcasts as well as order groceries, listen to music and bank online. They can also make a free appointment for one-on-one help from a technology mentor via phone or video call. 
Michaelson, a sophomore and National Honor Society member, has worked with many seniors remotely. ""Many of them were hesitant to try FaceTime or Zoom,"" said Michaelson, ""but [they] have come around."" 
While Cyber-Seniors offers help to older adults, two other student groups -- at Minneapolis South High School and Hopkins High School -- are offering help on the other end of the age spectrum. 
Cecelia Kaufman, a senior at Minneapolis South, started a free tutoring program with fellow high school students from around the country. Called Tutoring & Advising Program (TAP) -- taptutoring.com -- the outreach provides help in English, math, history, science and many other subjects to middle and high school students striving to keep up as online learning becomes the norm. 
The tutoring is done virtually, through platforms such as Google Hangouts, Zoom or Skype. 
Kaufman said most of the tutors are low-income students who have been recognized as QuestBridge National College Match finalists for their academic achievements. 
""I feel so fortunate to be giving back to students across the country who might be in a similar situation to my own,"" said Kaufman. 
A group of Hopkins High School alumni is also offering tutoring sessions, through the Hopkins Big Program. 
In its first week, 15 alumni remotely tutored 70 students in kindergarten through ninth grade through Skype and Zoom. 
""We wanted to set up connections so that kids could maintain some connection to school and older kids,"" said Jessica Melnik, who graduated from Hopkins in 2019 and is now studying political science at the University of Wisconsin. 
Hopkins alumna and Big mentor Mary O'Neil, majoring in business at Northeastern University in Boston, said parents can find it ""kind of daunting"" to be their student's only source of help. And students, too, can feel frustrated, and not necessarily eager for their parents help. ""So, I think that's a place where we can really help,"" she said. 
The Waters' volunteer Michaelson, too, finds the work rewarding. 
""My favorite part of being able to help these seniors is just knowing that I'm able to make an immediate positive change in their lives,"" said Michaelson. 
""Even though I can't see any of the seniors in person right now, everyone I've helped is always incredibly grateful and it's an amazing feeling to be able to help them.""",5/16/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
133,Bittersweet Solitude: [Foreign Desk],"He Was Thriving in New York's Art Scene. The Virus Changed Everything. 
""I definitely have leaned into being my own best friend."" 
Najee Wilson arrived in New York City nine years ago with the wonder of a young man enchanted by a vibrant setting. He had grown up in Charleston, S.C., and his new surroundings held inspiration. He could transform himself here. 
He began working in product design, but eventually became a muse -- a model who poses to inspire other artists. It was a calling after he lost nearly 150 pounds by embracing a lifestyle of yoga, running and biking. 
Then the threat of the coronavirus canceled Najee's work projects. His freelance life, which included costume design and curating drawing events, was upended. The community of artists he had befriended soon scattered. His roommate headed out of town. 
So Najee, 32, has been waiting out the pandemic alone in a two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood. He finds the situation almost poetic. 
""I think we've all seen enough movies to know that the end of the world happens in New York City, like, right in the middle of Times Square, when you're standing there with a coffee in your hand,"" he said, laughing. 
Quarantine, he has discovered, is not so bad. There is a newfound easiness to his life. A simplicity that has whittled things down to what is truly important. And the solitude forces him to engage with himself.
""If you don't talk to yourself, what else are you doing? I'll think a thought, and out loud I'll say, 'Oh my gosh, that's genius!""' he said. 
Sometimes he does not speak for an entire day. Other times he will be on the phone for hours with friends. He meditates, reads, peruses social media and goes down the black hole that is YouTube. 
Najee does get bored. And lonely. 
He's big into amusement parks and wonders when he'll get a chance to ride a roller coaster again. He misses the noise that once emanated from Eastern Parkway and the mango and blueberry smoothie from the neighborhood cafe. He wants to have up-close interactions. He wants a hug. 
""I just miss the feeling of being in the soup of New York City,"" Najee said. ""You know, when you're walking down some of the big avenues. You're just looking into the crowd that seems like it's endless and the faces are so different. And people have their own point of view and way of looking at life. It's like that mix of people, it's gone. And I don't know if it'll ever come back."" 
When the walls seem to close in, Najee heads outside for a bike ride or a walk in the park. Spring flowers seem more radiant, more aromatic than he remembers. 
He looks for jobs online, the prospects of which don't seem great. He has been rethinking his career, something he could do from home, maybe remote interior design -- although he'd love to also remain being a muse. 
Najee paid his bills in April with his stimulus check. In May, it was his unemployment check and some help from family that got him through. He is overwhelmed by the thought of being jobless in June. He and some neighbors are organizing a rent strike. 
If employment opportunities don't open up soon, he will consider leaving New York altogether. 
""It's really upsetting, and it's something I think I'm slightly in denial about,"" he said. ""It's hard to know where the future is.

134,Isolation is acute for new moms: The pandemic has altered plans many had for support,"Being a new mother would be lonely anyway, even without a pandemic . That’s what Giannina White tells herself. 
But White, 33, knows she’s more isolated than she expected. The first-time mother gave birth on March 16 — the first day her hospital stopped allowing visitors. She didn’t have to wear a mask, but she was asked screening questions before being allowed in to deliver. 
She had bought tiny suits for her son, Leo, to wear and made reservations for family brunches. A newborn photo shoot she had booked was canceled. On Mother’s Day, White introduced her family to her son, after asking that they not see anyone else for the weeks before. 
“It’s been really hard, because nobody’s been able to come relieve me other than my husband,” White said. “Nobody’s been able to come over, so it’s been really lonely.” 
For mothers of newborns during quarantine, regular challenges, emotional ups-and-downs and postpartum depression feel amplified. 
Susan Shelton is an advanced practice registered nurse and the assistant dean of undergraduate programs at the Florida State University College of Nursing. She said isolation for mothers during quarantine means less social support, which could strain their mental health. Shelton is also on the board for Postpartum Support International.
Up to 1 in 5 mothers will struggle with some form of postpartum mental health issues during their childbearing years, Shelton said. 
“Some moms are having to resolve the fact that what you had in your mind is not what you’re living in reality,” she said. 
Some have to not only manage their newborn, but older children as well. Emily Sutch, 29, had banked on her 2-year-old daughter being at day care while she was on maternity leave with her newborn son, who was born on March 12. 
That daughter, Layla, also 
wasn’t able to meet her brother for days after his birth — children weren’t allowed to visit the hospital because of coronavirus precautions. 
Day care was canceled, and now Sutch splits her time tending to both children. Sutch said she hopes day cares open up before her maternity leave ends in August, but she can’t be sure that they will. 
Amid all the craziness, Sutch has relied on contact with other mom friends. But it’s not the same virtually. When she had her daughter two years ago, she and other moms would go to the park, doing exercises with their strollers together and enjoying each other’s company. 
“We lean on each other for support and not really having that right now has been pretty difficult,” she said. 
Candyl Eyster has been caring for her two children, a newborn whom she delivered on March 5 and her 6- year-old. She’s only left the house for the doctor and on early morning runs, a piece of comfort that she’s reintroduced to her routine. 
She said delivery and labor are hard. The first few weeks postpartum are hard. And she was looking forward to meeting new moms , because her network is small. 
But now she spends more time worrying, wondering what would happen not only if her children got sick, but if she or her husband did. 
“You’re going over these thoughts all the time, sort of ruminating on them — what would we do if I got sick, how would we care for this person?” she said. 
Though Eyster worries, she said she realizes she’s in a more privileged position than other moms and should be grateful that at least she’s still employed and healthy. 
Along with regular health concerns, White said she’s been extra paranoid because her baby has bad allergies and acid reflux. Because the doctors are only taking emergency appointments, she said they haven’t been able to figure out exactly what he’s allergic to. 
Her baby spits up constantly — she calls the pediatrician twice a week, even though she badly wants to go in person and get her son help.

Shelton said Postpartum Support International has online support groups for different types of moms .

136,"The Solace of Solitary Encounters With Classical Music; Nothing can replace a live concert, but listening to great music alone can be the opposite of isolation and an antidote for loneliness","Nothing can replace the experience of a live concert of classical music . Yet magnificent as such events are, distractions often come along with the experience: the towering person in front of you blocking your view, the crinkle of someone unwrapping a candy, the dreaded cough at precisely the wrong moment. This dreadful pandemic has given us an opportunity to explore a different kind of listening — something both intimate and global, akin to meditation, in which you can sit inside yourself for whatever amount of time you choose or can spare. 
This sort of listening is the opposite of isolation . It is the antidote for loneliness . It can remove you from your physical environment, and you can be embraced by the geniuses who seemed to know everything about the human experience and wanted to tell you about it. 
And why did those great classical composers and artists feel the impulse to share with you? Because they knew that you would implicitly understand and be embraced by a time-traveling, death-defying art form that captures the communion of our species. 
Classical music is a triumph of the world's cultures, collected over thousands of years from the indigenous music of the first humans, carried on our trade routes by commerce, religion, war and our human curiosity. It took 35,000 years, from the Stone Age to the mid-19th century, to achieve the modern flute. Gold and bronze trumpets have been found in the tombs of the pharaohs. 
The core composers of the classical canon all lived in times of crises, personal and political, in which wars raged, bombs could be heard down the street, unexplained and untreatable illnesses were common, and the deaths of children, parents and loved ones were everyday occurrences. Beethoven lived alone in
The Solace of Solitary Encounters With Classical Music; Nothing can replace a live concert, but listening to great music alone can be the opposite… 
Vienna as Napoleon's troops invaded, all the while knowing that each day would bring him closer to total deafness—and he wrote music . Every Beethoven symphony, no matter how circuitous the journey, ends in the uplift of a major chord. Are you still feeling sorry for yourself? 
With the outbreak of World War I, the 39-year-old Maurice Ravel was too short and light to join the French army. Instead, he tended to the wounded and learned to drive, spending much of the war with his truck delivering supplies under incredibly dangerous conditions. He developed a heart condition, contracted dysentery, had to be operated on for a hernia and developed insomnia, from which he suffered until his death in 1937. 
And yet all the while he composed music . Twenty million people had died and another 21 million were left wounded in 1918, and after the fighting ceased, an influenza pandemic wiped out some 20 to 50 million more. Listen to Ravel—not just to how pretty and sly his eroticism is but to the steel in his veins, before and after his war experience. 
Many of us might never have considered setting aside time for ourselves to turn or return to the uniqueness of this music . Yet because of technology, that opportunity is easily accessible to most of us now. Do you have five minutes for yourself? Put on your earphones, go to YouTube and find any movement of any symphony by Mozart. Close your eyes. Do it every morning before you start your chores. 
Or give yourself the daily gift of Beethoven's piano sonatas at 4 p.m. It will take 32 days to hear them all, allotting about 20 minutes each day, and you will have created a concert series otherwise impossible in the ""real world."" 
This is Beethoven's 250th birthday year. Let him celebrate your life with his. His sonatas trace the life of a man who pounded his musical fist on the table to demand freedom for all people even as he demonstrated humility and acceptance, the existence of beauty in the midst of devastation, and the mystery of life and impending death—in other words, everything we need right now.

138,"Ack-worthy quarantine moments: Cartoonist who gave us ""Cathy"" is now posting daily ""Scenes From Isolation"" on Instagram.","""Cathy "" lives on Instagram -- and she's a character fit for these frazzled times. 
A decade after the eponymous comic strip's lengthy run ended, cartoonist Cathy Guisewite brought back her much loved and much mocked character (whose struggles with the four ""guilt groups"" of work, food, love and mom never abated, even as new generations of women embraced changing sensibilities) in single-frame cartoons, shared through @cathygwite. 
Since March, Guisewite has been capturing our collective pandemic anxieties and ack -worthy quarantine moments in a series of daily ""Cathy "" posts called ""Scenes From Isolation ."" 
We talked with Guisewite, who launched the paperback edition of her essay book ""Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault"" this spring, about her latest cartoons and how she's managing solo self- quarantine in California with her dog. She's missing her 98-year-old mom, yet finding solace in old routines -- and even Cathy -haters have reached out to say they suddenly relate to the character. 
Q: How did you decide to begin posting a comic every day during the pandemic? 
A: After all those years of doing the strip, when my anxiety builds 
up in me, I have to kind of dump it out on paper. So I found great solace in dumping some of this out. And, truthfully, this is a time when people are reconnecting with old friends, old foods, old people they know. 
Q: Are you finding the daily routine helpful?
A: This is kind of my comfort zone, I'm afraid, waking up in the morning and being panicked that I need an idea for the day. There's something very comforting about that, because that was the rhythm of my life for all those years I did the comic strip. It's partly just kind of a natural relief -- getting some of the angst on paper. 
Q: Cathy 's frazzled nature seems to be something many of us are tapping into right now. 
A: We're all carrying this giant weight of terror about everything. One of my favorite ones I did is one that's just labeled ""Coronaphobia."" Cathy 's kind of leaning over the countertop, holding her squirt bottle of ""anti bac"" and it says ""Fear of absolutely everything."" It's hard to not be anxious when that's kind of our collective mental state. 
Q: What have you been hearing from your Instagram followers? 
A: I've heard from a lot of people who say, ""Omigod, I used to relate to Cathy , but now I really, really relate to her."" They have greeted her like a long-lost old friend. But I've also heard from quite a few people who have said, ""You know, I used to really not like Cathy , but now I really love her, because now I'm kind of like her, now I've got my face in the bowl of mashed potatoes like Cathy and I'm throwing the scale in the trash, like Cathy ."" 
Q: How is drawing one-panel cartoons different from having a running strip? 
A: It's simpler to not be worrying about a story line. It's just a different discipline. It's also interesting, because the four panels of a comic strip are very restrictive; you can only say so much in four boxes. When I ended that, it was really with the dream of getting to write something longer, where I was not constricted by the four boxes. 
So when I had the chance to do the book of essays, I mean, it was like coming home and taking off the Spanx. This was liberating. Because I could write on and on about subjects a lot more thoughtfully and with a lot more depth. ... It's kind of funny to me, I've gone from my dream of the big essays, which were my dream coming from the four boxes of the comic strip, and now I'm down to one little three-inch square. 
Q: Which ""isolation"" cartoons have struck the biggest chord for readers? 
A: I got a great response from [one of the] poems I did, which was a poem of disgust. It's a close-up of Cathy in a shower cap. And it's titled ""A poem of disgust."" And she looks disgusted. On one side of her is a bottle of soothing bubble bath, and on the other side is a box of calming tea. She is saying, ""Another bubble bath, another cup of tea. I'm safe from the virus, but I'm oh so sick of me."" 
Q: For you personally, what has been the most difficult about this isolation time? 
A: I am so sick of cleaning things, that's the worst. I don't see any humans, at all, except for the ones that I glare at when I walk my dog. Everybody's trying to use the same side of the sidewalk. I'm missing people, and I miss human contact, and I miss not being afraid of everything. 
The thing I hate the most, on top of everything else is that my mom is 98 years old in Florida and I can't get on a plane and go spend time with her. I don't know when I'll be able to do that, and it makes me crazy. 
Q: So is Cathy back in your life for good now?
A: It's my personal commitment to do one every day for a while, during the quarantine anyway. I don't think that I'm going to continue doing one every day for a long time, but, yes, I think I'm going to keep doing something every week. I love that connection with people. 
Reconnecting with people on Instagram , it's just reminded me that it's nice for the character to be out there for that. I really like feeling like, in the same way that she could give somebody a smile way back when, that she can give somebody a smile right now about these times.",5/28/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3
140,"For artists hit hard by isolation, a creative jolt","The limbo of this extended quarantine has forced us all into a state of increased resourcefulness. This has been especially true for artists , curators and musicians, whose outlets for sharing their work have been swiftly limited to laptops and balconies. 
Take David Plylar, lead curator in the music division at the Library of Congress. In considering how he could continue the library's mission to commission new music (about 600 pieces since 1925), Plylar reached for an idea he's had on his bookshelf for 20 years. 
When he was in school studying music composition, he read ""The Decameron,"" 14-century author Giovanni Boccaccio's masterful collection of 100 stories as told by 10 acquaintances isolating from the bleakest stretch of the plague in a secluded Italian villa. 
""I always wanted to write a piece about it, doing something with this idea of having multiple viewpoints presented,"" Plylar says in a phone interview. ""But of course, the problem was that I was just myself and didn't have time to do 100 pieces."" 
He still doesn't. But Plylar did detect parallels between Boccaccio's tales - which served as tethers to a world left behind by its sheltering tellers - and our current circumstances. 
Working with other curators and specialists at the library over the past month, Plylar assembled 10 pairs of composers and performers to collaborate remotely on short solo compositions (between one and three minutes) that he's calling the ""The Boccaccio Project."" The pieces will be recorded and premiere on the LOC website over 10 days starting June 15 and continuing on weekdays through June 26.
Though taking only structural cues from ""The Decameron,"" Plylar expects the 10 works - the manuscripts of which will be archived by the library - to be as wide-ranging in tone and tenor as the text's 100 tales, largely due to the project's unique pairings and the unusual demands of remote collaboration. 
The New York-based pianist Jenny Lin is collaborating with California composer Cliff Eidelman. Oboist Andrew Nogal and pianist Daniel Pesca of Chicago's Grossman Ensemble are taking on works by Baltimore composer Richard Drehoff and Indiana-based Aaron Travers, respectively. Flutist Nathalie Joachim of Chicago's Flutronix is paired with composer (and fellow flutist) Allison Loggins-Hull. And members of ensembles including San Francisco's Del Sol String Quartet and New York's Wet Ink Ensemble are teaming with composers such as Luciano Chessa, Erin Rogers and Ashkan Behzadi. 
Violinist Jannina Norpoth of the New York-based PUBLIQuartet and composer Niloufar Nourbakhsh both had operas in progress when the pandemic struck and cleared their calendars. 
""I was so uninspired to finish [the opera], I was really creatively kind of dead,"" Nourbakhsh says over a Zoom call. ""And then when this came up, because it's so short and we have to get it done so quickly, it just gave me a lot of creative energy. It got me out of the hole that I was in."" 
Norpoth, her neighbor in hard - hit Brooklyn, could relate. ""As somebody who thrives off of working with other people all the time,"" she says, "" a lot of the places where I gather inspiration are just not there right now. So this was a really nice way to connect, even virtually."" 
Nourbakhsh's piece for Norpoth, ""A Shared Solitary,"" incorporates field recordings of the city (specifically its noisy nightly celebration of health-care workers) as well as a delay system she created in the programming language Max. At first, Norpoth's notes stretch out and gently overlap, but over three minutes, their sound gradually tightens toward an ecstatic climax. Things change fast, it seems to say. But Nourbakhsh's elastic approach to time and the music's mediation through technology both feel like ways to capture this unsettling moment, if only for a few minutes. 
Elsewhere in New York, composer and sound artist Miya Masaoka hasn't left her high-rise apartment since early March. The pandemic forced cancellations of two premieres - an orchestral work and a Noh opera - a residency and a commission. 
For her, the opportunity to quickly collaborate with cellist Kathryn Bates of the Del Sol quartet was a way for a familiar relationship (Masaoka wrote a string quartet for Del Sol in 2010) to explore an uncertain condition. 
""I think the situation of these quarantines, these lockdowns, is that at times it's really dark, and then at times it can also be a really creative space,"" she says over Zoom. ""It can flip-flop in a day and it can flip-flop in two minutes."" 
Her piece for Bates, ""Intuit (A Way to Stay in This World)"" reflects this shifting sense of the present, capturing everything from the dizzying influx of daily data to the intense compression of our attention spans. 
""You're in this moment and you're just trying to keep your feet on the ground,"" Bates says of Masaoka's piece. ""There are these ebbs and flows in the way the music moves. For me, it's what it's like to be in this present. Every minute is different, every hour is different. It feels like it's never going to change and yet it's constantly
changing."" 
For both artists , Plylar's initiative offered a way to be heard beyond the walls of their apartments, but also a heartening signal that they're not alone in trying to keep the music going. 
""I think as individual artists , we're maybe already able to pivot very quickly,"" Bates says. ""But to see the great stuff that's happening as the organizations are able to do things they've never done before, I think that's really fantastic."" 
And the feeling is mutual for Plylar, who, after just a few weeks, has already started receiving finished scores. He expects the forthcoming recorded performances to be enhanced by their tight timelines and technological constraints - features that lend the project a documentary subtext and ""show what the situation is in a real way."" 
""I'm amazed to see how adaptable these musicians are to the circumstances in which they find themselves,"" he says. ""We're kind of embracing this element of making do with what you have.""",5/29/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1
146,Isolation must be recognized as a form of elder abuse by Illinois task force,"The nation's ongoing COVID-19 crisis brings a distressing poignancy to the problem of elder abuse . Elders everywhere sadly find themselves in long-term protective isolation from their own families. For those in congregate settings such as nursing homes, both the risk of the coronavirus and the experience of isolation are especially acute. 
Yet even in normal times, tens of thousands of elders across our nation are traumatically isolated from their closest family members from the day they lose independence until the day they die. 
Such isolation is carried out both in congregate facilities and in private homes, sometimes at the direction of a ""rogue"" family member who wants to seize power over the elder and his or her assets. It is rank exploitation of our elders in their weakness and old age, no matter who commits it. 
The abusers in these situations steal a lot more than power or money when they isolate our aged loved ones. They steal the final chapters of close and lifelong relationships -- our last and only chances to be together. 
Tragically, when elder isolation occurs within a family, it can pit some members of the family against others, making it difficult for the elder justice system to distinguish abusers from victims and stop the abuse . 
Why is elder abuse within families the third rail of elder protection in Illinois , even though it constitutes 76% of all elder abuse cases logged by the Illinois Department on Aging's Adult Protective Services? 
The problem is that here, and in so many other states, the law largely doesn't ""see"" abusive elder isolation within families. It sees in-family financial abuse and mainly responds to that by probating wills and estates after an elder has died.
Traumatic and costly guardianship proceedings likewise put elders ' mental capacity on trial while putting obvious evidence of elder isolation and manipulation on the back burner. But what if all of the legal firepower that today gets channeled into stripping elders of their legal agency and making them wards of the court were channeled into combating elder abuse instead? 
Even Adult Protective Services, which handles some 18,000 cases annually, puts the burden on elders . In order for caseworkers to take any action, the dependent elder must speak up against the very person who has them isolated. This helps explain why only 40% of the elder abuse reports APS receives are confirmed, let alone remedied in any way. 
Law enforcement, for its part, depends on APS to refer cases -- and on abused elders or their family members to cooperate in cases that could result in sending another family member to jail. What most family members really want is not to send anyone to jail, but simply for the abusive behavior to stop. 
For all these reasons and more, Illinois ' Elder Abuse Task Force , appointed last summer by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and co-chaired by Sen. Rachelle Crowe, D-Glen Carbon, and Rep. Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, must put elder isolation at the top of its agenda. 
This agenda must be driven by the fact that elders only need be functionally dependent -- not mentally incompetent -- in order to be vulnerable to traumatic isolation and manipulation by a family member who betrays their trust. The system must stop insisting on evidence of severe suffering or death before it will act. And it must stop pursuing guardianship as its principal approach to elder abuse . 
Right now, even before the Elder Abuse Task Force delivers its recommendations to the governor, every Illinois adult deserves to know we will have the right to the same close family relationships after we lose independence that we enjoyed before losing it. Elder isolation is elder abuse .",6/8/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,12
148,The pandemic is a lonely time. These poems speak to our sense of solitude.,"English professor on Wordsworth, Bishop and other writers who 'wandered lonely as a Cloud' 
When something terrible happens, I choose a poem to share with my students, one that might offer a little solace. I learned this trick in college. After the 9/11 attacks, one of my professors shared W.H. Auden's ""September 1, 1939,"" a poem that warns, ""We must love one another or die."" So when my students did not return to campus after spring break, when they instead appeared on my laptop screen, each alone in their childhood bedroom, I decided to look for a poem that might help us feel less isolated in this time of social distancing. The poems I found instead reminded me that it doesn't take a pandemic to feel lonesome. Some of the most famous poems are about solitude , which won't come as a surprise if you've met a poet. As we all stay home, these verses about isolation can help us see that social life is always about distance, one way or another. 
My search began with a famous poem about solitude by William Wordsworth, which opens like this: I wandered lonely as a Cloud 
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills, 
When all at once I saw a crowd 
A host of golden Daffodils.
Long story short, the flowers cheer him up. The rest of the poem is about what "" a jocund company"" they make. Instead of lamenting dismal isolation, he ends up praising "" the bliss of solitude ,"" from which he remembers the daffodils. This wistful conclusion might ring hollow when you learn that the poem was inspired by a real walk the poet took with his sister, Dorothy, whom he conveniently pushed out of the frame to paint a more solitary verbal picture of the day. 
Writing around 1,100 years earlier, the Chinese poet Li Bai offers short, vivid poems that capture more genuine sadness: 
Moonlight before my bed 
Perhaps frost on the ground. 
Lift my head and see the moon 
Lower my head and I miss my home. 
Such spare, piercing verses are not reserved for poets of the distant past, however. If you miss the friends and lovers who made you who you are, think of ""Separation,"" a three-liner by W.S. Merwin: 
Your absence has gone through me 
Like thread through a needle. 
Everything I do is stitched with its color. 
Separation from those who crowd our daily lives can bring to mind more powerfully the people who really matter. Maybe that's why so many of us have been reconnecting with longtime friends who live too far away for the local happy hour. 
When I searched my own syllabi for poems about loneliness, those that I found tended to focus on missing a specific individual, as the Merwin poem does. A favorite of this kind is by Anne Bradstreet, who wrote ""A Letter to her Husband, absent upon Publick employment"" around 1642, while he was away founding Boston. Bradstreet asks bluntly why they must remain apart, when such a strong bond draws them together: 
If two be one, as surely thou and I, 
How stayest thou there 
whilst I at Ipswich lie? 
In such poems , to long for an individual serves to conjure a general lonesomeness. Elizabeth Bishop's wrenching villanelle, ""One Art,"" can be seen this way. A report on ""the art of losing,"" it starts with the local and trivial, ""lost door keys, the hour badly spent,"" and then zooms out to show bigger losses, ""two cities . . . two rivers, a continent,"" before at last returning to the more intimate scale to identify the greatest loss of all, ""losing you.""
Other poets, including some of Bishop's contemporaries, have shown that distance from a special someone can make a full house seem vacant. Few underscore this as poignantly as Frank O'Hara, a man so popular that at his funeral someone offered these words: ""Frank O'Hara was my best friend. There are at least 60 people in New York who thought Frank O'Hara was their best friend."" Despite all that company, O'Hara turns the intimate distance of lost love into an almost paradoxical lament. In the final lines of ""Morning,"" he calls out, 
if there is a 
place further from me 
I beg you do not go. 
Yes, separation from just one person can make the world seem empty; no wonder the quarantine is such an ordeal. 
None of these poems felt right for my students today, possibly because social distancing is different from these more familiar forms of absence - and from poems of mourning, an ancient and uniquely depressing genre all its own. Now our partners and children and housemates are often the only ones we can still get close to - perhaps a bit too close. And when I connect with my students or friends via Zoom, our conversations rarely mask the fact that we're each alone with our computers. Such is the experience of being ""alone together,"" to borrow a phrase from sociologist Sherry Turkle. What we've lost is the less intimate closeness of strangers, the ease of opening a door for someone, or shaking hands, or sharing the sidewalk comfortably, or even, with apologies to O'Hara, having a Coke with you. As a friend recently posted on Twitter, ""I miss overhearing things."" The most interesting poems of social distance are those that address this more complex loneliness. 
The effort to remain six feet from others on the sidewalk, meanwhile, makes a ballet of this fact known to all city dwellers: The street is where ""social"" and ""distance"" meet. In "" To a Passerby,"" the French poet Charles Baudelaire recounts his infatuation with a beautiful woman whom he knows he'll never see again. It's an experience specific to Baudelaire's 19th-century flânerie - strolling through the world as the world flows around you - but it should be familiar to anyone who's watched a masked stranger float past their 
window. As Claude McKay's ""On Broadway"" reminds us, we can feel lonesome even on a busy street: Oh wonderful is Broadway - only 
My heart, my heart is lonely . 
As an African American writing about the Great White Way in the 1920s, McKay may allude to an especially damaging kind of exclusion. But his poem also makes the broader point that even if I could immerse myself in a crowd, I might still feel alone. Another city poet, John Ashbery, keeps the social distance inside in ""This Room,"" a poem of droll claustrophobia. ""Surely all those feet on the sofa were mine,"" the poet muses, sounding like someone stuck inside for weeks. ""We had macaroni for lunch every day,"" he recalls, as if predicting my own lockdown menu. Like O'Hara's poem above, this one ends with a strange call to absent others: 
Why do I tell you these things?

2/3/23, 3:19 PM The pandemic is a lonely time. These poems speak to our sense of solitude. - ProQuest 
You are not even here. 
Both of these calls to ""you"" seem directed at someone almost too distant to hear. They invoke the same feelings of emptiness and distance that now pervade our ersatz social lives online. 
Like the contagion we're fighting, the poetry of social distance is not confined to small apartments and city streets. In fact, rural settings can highlight how distance structures social life. Your closest neighbor might live miles away, but you might know her better than if she lived across the hall in an apartment building. Robert Frost chronicles these rural dynamics in ""Mending Wall,"" which recounts how two neighbors meet each springtime on opposite sides of the stacked-stone wall that divides their properties. Stones keep rolling off the wall, so they walk the line yearly, replacing fallen rocks as they go. ""Something there is that doesn't love a wall,"" the poem begins. Tell me about it, I think from my home office. Eventually, the speaker tries to convince his neighbor that they 
do not need the wall: 
He is all pine and I am apple orchard. 
My apple trees will never get across 
And eat the cones under his pines. 
In response to this sensible point, the neighbor gives his famous refrain: ""Good fences make good neighbors."" The speaker of Frost's poem doesn't seem to understand, but perhaps the reader will. It's not just that fences help us respect social boundaries. Rather, the wall that separates these neighbors also gives them a reason to meet up and work together. 
As I tell my students when I teach ""Mending Wall,"" that stone wall gives us a rich figure for the balance of contact and separation that keeps the social fabric together. When I shared the poem this semester, I also suggested that the wall provides a close analogue for the ethos of social distancing we've adopted: What good neighbors do together is put up barriers between each other, and it's by our very separation that we work together. Like the neighbor's terse and initially puzzling aphorism, the now-familiar term ""social distance"" at first had an oxymoronic texture. How inapt that the most prosocial thing we can do is to avoid one another. But lots of great poems about social life recognize that distance plays a role in even our most intimate social moments. Poets remind us that deep feelings of isolation can arise even when we've got company, that our most powerful connections may be those that bridge the greatest distances and that sometimes, the best thing we can do for our social worlds is to maintain walls between us.",6/14/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,neither,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,4,4
149,"The Toll That Isolation Takes on Kids During the Coronavirus Era; Playing with peers has important developmental benefits, and doctors worry that children are missing out on them now.","After six weeks of lockdown due to Covid-19 , Cari Marshall was getting concerned about her 11-year-old daughter Chloe. The child missed seeing her friends in person and was becoming frustrated communicating with them solely via FaceTime, TikTok and the gaming app Roblox. 
""It laid bare how important her personal relationships are to her daily happiness,"" says Ms. Marshall, a political volunteer organizer in Austin, Texas. ""She is all about her friendships."" 
With many summer camps canceled , many families continuing to practice social distancing and the 
upcoming school year a big question mark, pediatricians and psychologists are raising alarms about the potential impact of prolonged social isolation on children . Some point to research that has found an array of benefits of positive peer relationships: Children who have them are more likely to later develop healthy romantic relationships and be more effective at work. Good relationships with peers during the teen years are linked to better health during adulthood. 
""There's a key connection between having good peer interactions and social emotional well-being,"" says Rebecca Rialon Berry, clinical associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Health in New York. ""In certain populations, we're seeing that our depression and anxiety are heightening with continued quarantining"" and other aspects of the pandemic. ""We have to start talking about the calculated risk and taking some more."" 
There's already evidence that social isolation may lead to mental health issues. About 23% of elementary school students in Hubei province in China had symptoms of depression and 19% had anxiety symptoms after two or more months of home confinement earlier this year during the region's coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey of 1,784 children published in April in JAMA Pediatrics. 
Psychologists are particularly concerned about how socially anxious children and others who already struggle making or keeping friends will fare. These youngsters might be relieved now to have a break from the social minefield of the lunchroom or playground, but ""not having as many opportunities to practice, you might see a kind of withering of the social skills or a lack of development of the social skills,"" says Eli R. Lebowitz, associate professor at the Child Study Center at Yale School of Medicine. 
Children are less likely than adults to become seriously ill from Covid-19 and many show few symptoms. However, there have been rare cases of a dangerous complication called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children . And doctors are still trying to understand how easily infected children could spread the virus to more vulnerable people. 
Friendships play different roles throughout children 's development. For preschoolers, playing with other children and ""learning to share, keeping your hands to yourself"" helps develop our ""core moral building blocks of empathy, perspective-taking, negotiation, collaboration and cooperation,"" says Dr. Rialon Berry. Playing with peers teaches children to regulate their emotions and behavior. ""If we can do so, more people are going to want to hang with us and play with us,"" she says. These skills are critical to navigating all sorts of adult relationships. 
Preschoolers need to interact with other children to learn these lessons, says Kenneth Rubin, professor of human development and quantitative methodology at the University of Maryland. ""Parents just can't tell kids how they should act with other kids ,"" he says. ""Children learn to be kind based on their understanding of how others feel and that they are in need of a hug."" 
During the elementary school years, time with friends allows social skills to sharpen as children hone their ""ability to take the perspective of others. There are opportunities to examine and discuss alternative and conflicting ideas and to compromise,"" Dr. Rialon Berry says. Competing with peers on sports teams and in academics helps kids learn about winning, losing and managing conflict, says Karen L. Bierman, director of the Child Study Center at Pennsylvania State University. And the growing complexity of children 's relationships— the changing roster of best friends and peer groups—teaches children to manage challenging emotions like jealousy, Dr. Bierman says. 
For teenagers, relationships with peers help them ""develop a sense of identity and values,"" says Mary Alvord, a psychologist in Chevy Chase, Md. As teens separate from parents they rely on their friends for social support and help navigating the choppy waters of adolescence, notes Dr. Rialon Berry. 
""Of all age groups, this virus is probably more socially devastating to teens than any other group. They are bored and they are lonely,"" says Joseph P. Allen, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia. The teen years are when children ""learn to manage issues of intimacy and loyalty and boundaries that are crucial to adult functioning,"" he says. Dr. Allen points to the rising rates of anxiety and depression among teens in recent years. Studies have also found that teens and young adults report more feelings of loneliness than any other age group. Social isolation may make these problems worse, Dr. Allen says.

How are you trying to balance the risks to children during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. 
Connecting with peers digitally can help children maintain friendships. Teens and many tweens already had robust digital social lives before the pandemic, of course. Texting, meet-ups on Zoom and multiplayer videogames have filled some of children 's need for social connection. 
But digital playdates won't be sufficient for younger children , says Dimitri Christakis, a pediatrician and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children 's Research Institute. ""It is immensely important to be physically present the younger you are ,"" Dr. Christakis says. ""Social emotional learning happens when they are physically present with peers learning to negotiate and share. You can't do that over Zoom."" Dr. Rialon Berry says that while some of her tween and teen patients seem content with online socializing, others are craving physical closeness. ""Some say, 'I just want a hug,'"" from their friends, she says. ""The neurochemical response that comes from human touch is real."" 
And even the most ardent online social butterflies can get tired of virtual get-togethers, especially since crucial cues like eye contact and body language can be missing . Dr. Alvord suggests that children keep online meetups interesting by playing old-school games like charades or Scattergories. Dr. Allen advises 
teens to prioritize interacting with friends one-one-one over making ""curated"" posts on Instagram and Snapchat. 
Franklin Mendelsohn, an 18-year-old graduating high school senior in Silver Spring, Md., says the pandemic has caused him to re-evaluate some of his friendships. He's mostly been socializing with friends on Discord, a communication platform popular with videogamers. But one high school friend rebuffed his efforts to connect online. ""Being socially distant from people makes it very clear who actually wants to talk to you,"" he says. ""It's very easy to weed out people who are friends of convenience."" But Mr. Mendelsohn has also reconnected with an elementary school friend and now plays videogames and communicates on Discord with him every day. ""We have so much time,"" he says. 
Some families are experimenting with socially distanced playdates outdoors where children stay at least 6 feet apart, sometimes wearing masks. Many pediatricians and psychologists recommend this approach for older elementary schoolers, tweens and teens. ""Even though you're 6 feet apart, the social cognitive neurochemistry is firing like crazy, hearing their stories and who likes who and who doesn't like who,"" says Arthur Lavin, a pediatrician in Beachwood, Ohio, and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on psychosocial aspects of child and family health. Dr. Alvord recommends activities like riding bikes, skateboarding and drawing with chalk on driveways, things that are relatively easy to do while staying physically apart. Younger children , however, aren't likely to be able to keep their distance and their play generally requires close contact. 
Sarah Morford of Williamsburg, Va., has come up with some creative ways to keep her daughter Marilyn, 5, and son George, 4, connected to their friends. Marilyn, in particular, loves drawing pictures, painting rocks and making bracelets. Most Fridays, Ms. Morford drives Marilyn to her friends' houses so she can drop off the homemade gifts in their mailboxes. ""She has the recipient in mind as she's making the thing,"" says Ms. Morford, who owns a mobile spray-tanning business. 
For families with multiple children , siblings do provide a built-in kid to play with —and fight with . But doctors and psychologists say that siblings can't fill the role peers do. ""Almost invariably they're not the same age. Their skills are at different levels,"" says Yale's Dr. Lebowitz. Siblings often compete for parent's attention and may have dramatically different interests.
Dr. Christakis is a proponent of ""pods,"" where two families that have been isolating team up and allow in person gatherings without social distancing. Dr. Bierman says children will benefit from connecting closely even with just one friend. ""Think of [ children ] as having a social emotional learning deficit. Try to make up for it with extra time with friends,"" Dr. Christakis says. 
In late April, Ms. Marshall in Austin began arranging socially distant one- on -one outdoor playdates with one of her daughter Chloe's closest friends. In late May, she started them with a few more friends. The children swim at opposite ends of the pool, watch movies on a large screen Ms. Marshall put up in the family's yard and make TikTok videos. The rules are ""no sharing food, keeping distance, no hugs or kisses,"" Ms. Marshall 
says. 
Chloe is thrilled. ""It's exciting and I feel really happy"" to see friends, the soon-to-be sixth-grader says. ""I missed them a lot.""",6/15/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4
150,Isolation and harmful drinking: Addiction experts worried about all the 'quarantinis' we're having,"The boredom of staying home and the intense anxiety produced by the pandemic has caused a spike in alcohol sales and Twitter jokes about drinking before noon. 
But addiction experts say they are worried it could also trigger more serious drinking problems and even create new ones for people who have never struggled with alcohol dependency before. 
""I expect we're going to see pretty significant increases in what I call unhealthy alcohol use, which means drinking above recommended limits,"" said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, an addiction medicine doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 
""It will be pretty unlikely for someone who has never tried alcohol before to start drinking for the first time and immediately develop an alcohol use disorder,"" Wakeman said. ""I would see this as a risk more in people who are already drinking and then their alcohol use escalates."" 
Before the pandemic, Mhairi McFarlane, 44, a novelist in Nottingham, England, had been thinking of cutting back. But the first weekend she was in quarantine, she said, she was ""cheerfully"" having three or four drinks a night, usually gin and tonics or ""very cold bottles of cava."" 
""It was very much not my style of drinking ,"" she said. ""I've always associated drink with going out and being social. I was never really one for opening a bottle of wine in front of the television."" 
Drinking alone worried her. Then she woke up one Thursday with a headache and a sense that her body was unhappy with what she was doing. She decided to give herself a two-night break from drinking . To her surprise, she wanted to keep going. It has been two months since she had a drink.
""My brother said of all the shocks of 2020, 'none have been as great as you becoming the poster girl for sobriety,' "" McFarlane said. 
Kelly Rubinsohn, an opera singer in Philadelphia, said she normally drinks wine. 
But in isolation , she has been playing with cocktail recipes, making Manhattans and experimenting with barrel-rested gin. 
She was furloughed from her job as an office manager at an architectural firm, and a series of singing auditions she booked were canceled. 
Drinking has been a salve during a difficult time, said Rubinsohn, 32. 
""There is literally nothing else to control,"" she said. ""I can at least make a cocktail."" 
Alcohol sales spiked in late March, rising 55% compared with the same period a year earlier. But it was unclear if Americans were consuming more alcohol or if the jump was indicative of a change in the way people were buying wine and spirits now that they could no longer drink in bars and restaurants. Analysts said that a change in shopping habits, as Americans took to stockpiling to limit the amount of time they spent in stores, most likely accounted for some of the increase. 
Sales of beer, wine and spirits have since slowed, although they still remain much higher than a year ago, according to Nielsen, the market research firm. 
In April, Morning Consult, a digital media and polling company, found that only 16% of 2,200 respondents said they were drinking more, while 19% said they were drinking less. A narrow majority, 55%, said their drinking habits remained unchanged, according to the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. 
Still, addiction specialists say they are watching carefully to see how isolation will affect drinking and drug use in general. 
Historically, drinking and drug use rise when people experience wars, terrorist attacks or natural disasters, but those are typically localized events, said Adam Leventhal, director of the University of Southern California Institute for Addiction Science. ""A pandemic of this magnitude affecting the entire globe is something we've never encountered before,"" he said. ""Every person is being affected by it."" 
A study published last month in the Asian Journal of Psychiatry showed a sharp increase among people in China who reported "" harmful drinking "" during isolation . People between the ages of 21 and 40 were particularly susceptible, the study found. 
Harmful drinking is generally defined as drinking to excess in a way that leads to health problems. Alcohol dependency, or alcoholism, is characterized by cravings that are difficult to control and a preoccupation with alcohol that leads to continued drinking even when a person knows it will have negative consequences. 
""Social isolation , limited interaction, financial distress are causing excessive stress, which has direct correlations with alcohol consumption,"" said Md Zahir Ahmed, an author of the study, which showed that the rate of harmful drinking and dependence went up 6.7% during the lockdown in China.
The pandemic has reduced access to social support networks, while alcohol remains fairly easy to get. That combination means ""there remains a threat to develop new substance-use disorders,"" even among casual drinkers, Ahmed said. 
People should not feel shame or jump to the conclusion that they are addicted to alcohol because of a few nights of heavy drinking , Wakeman said. 
""Everyone is cutting themselves some slack because these are crazy times,"" she said. ""But the same way we do with food and exercise and concerns about obesity, we want to have some benchmarks for how to stay healthy."" 
People should seek help if family and friends express concerns about their drinking , if they continue to want to drink even if it causes problems, or if their drinking begins to get in the way of everyday responsibilities, like taking care of their children or working, Wakeman said. 
Andrew Beile, 31, a former bartender, started the Facebook page ""Quarantined Beer Chugs"" as a way to replace the bar culture he lost when the pandemic shut down pubs and breweries around Liberty, Missouri, where he lives. 
The idea was for friends to film themselves drinking and then post videos online. Beile said he thought at most 50 people would join the group. The page now has 330,000 members. 
""Once it got big, we decided we needed to encourage people not to drink seven times a week,"" Beile said. ""So we changed our motto to 'All chugs are welcome.' "" 
Followers are encouraged to chug water three times a week on ""hydration days.""

156,Social isolation during COVID-19 pandemic has hidden health risks -- especially for seniors,"As cases of COVID- 19 rise again, it can be hard for older adults to see any end to the need for social isolation and the loneliness that can come with it. 
For months now, they have been following public health advice to reduce their risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus by staying home, knowing an infection can have life-threatening complications. But sheltering at home has also meant staying distant from family, friends and the places that kept them active and engaged. 
Inadvertently, the COVID- 19 safety guidelines to self-isolate have created new health risks by leaving many older adults even more socially isolated and inactive than before. 
We have been examining social connectedness in old age and the detrimental effects of social isolation and loneliness on physical and mental health . We're concerned about the paradox of government directives for physical distancing that protect older adults from COVID- 19 but that might actually result in more social isolation . 
We believe public health officials need to look closely at this potential risk in their messaging and identify strategies to minimize the unintended consequences. 
Even before the pandemic began, national studies indicated that nearly a quarter of older Americans were socially isolated and about one-third of middle-aged and older adults experienced loneliness. 
Having few social connections and feeling isolated have been associated with myriad health -related conditions, including chronic diseases and psychiatric disorders. Social isolation is now viewed as a risk factor for premature death, similar to cigarette smoking, physical inactivity or obesity.
Social distancing during the pandemic was never meant to thwart social connections, but many family members, friends and neighbors of older adults are staying away to avoid exposing their loved ones to the virus. While that protects older adults from some health risks , the limited physical interactions reduce feelings of connectedness with others. It can also exacerbate other health risks . 
Without frequent and meaningful social interactions and stimulation, older adults' cognitive functioning can decline. As the days of isolation wear on, older adults are especially susceptible to depression and anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts. Remaining at home also makes it harder to engage in healthy lifestyles, including physical activity and eating well. 
Without exercise, muscles can weaken, leaving older adults more prone to falling. Inactivity can also lead to weight gain and other health problems, including declining heart and lung capacity. Access to healthy food is also necessary for staying healthy and for preventing and managing chronic conditions. 
While not everyone will see the same impacts, the older adults most likely to be affected include those who already experience social isolation , live alone or have limited financial resources, as well as those with multiple physical ailments, mental health concerns and memory problems. 
Older adults can take steps on their own to stay active and engaged: 
* Plan your day. While the days may seem to be an endless blur, keep up with daily routines like getting out of bed, getting dressed and being engaged with small activities. Planning time for online classes, calls with friends, reading, puzzles, cooking, gardening or home repairs can give meaning to the days. 
* Stay physically active. Find exercises that can be done at home or in the immediate neighborhood, like walking. Many virtual and online physical activity and health promotion programs are available, which can remotely foster engagement and connection to others. 
* Know your risk . Use the AARP Foundation's Connect2Affect tool to assess your risk for being socially isolated, and refer to the local assistance directory for support services you might need. 
* Don't be afraid to leave home, but do so wisely. New CDC guidelines emphasize what older adults can do to stay safe when leaving home. For example, when going outside, practice everyday preventive actions: Carry a cloth face covering, tissues and hand sanitizer; encourage others to wear cloth face coverings when out in public; and avoid close contact with others who are not wearing face masks to the extent possible. 
* Think of others. Regularly reach out to others who may need to hear a friendly voice on the phone. Volunteering has been shown to have many positive health benefits, and there are online opportunities for doing so. 
* Accept help from others. Many individuals and organizations are working hard to keep seniors socially connected. Remain open to accepting the kindness and support from family members, friends, health care providers and social service agencies. 
For older adults, staying healthy and safe means also staying socially connected while following public health recommendations. Public health efforts to stop the spread of COVID- 19 should also take into account the importance of social connectivity for maintaining older adults' physical and mental health .",7/7/20,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,11
157,Being alone can be sad and scary. But it can also be calm and wonderful.,"As I type on my work computer, I suddenly realize I am alone . Not just alone in my house during the pandemic lockdown. But alone in my building with my next-door neighbors in the semidetached house gone to Bethany Beach, Del., for the duration. And even alone in my virtual world where all the other team members have already left for the weekend. ""How much more alone could I be ?"" I think. 
Of course, there are all kinds of alone . Some are sad . Some terrifying. Some calming. Some not even really alone . 
When I was growing up the youngest of five children in a very raucous household, I spent time trying to find places to be alone - climbing trees, sitting in the garage, bicycling through the neighborhood. I finally found that the best way to have alone time was to sit in my room. I shared my room with Daddy's tools, some of Mother's books, the ironing board and the clothes dryer. I never had to worry someone would interrupt me when I sat in my unairconditioned room with the dryer on during the day. In August. In Texas. 
I spent many hours there ""telling myself stories"" as I framed it. Imagining that I was fearless, strong, resourceful and a terrific singer. And I always got the guy. I'd try to imagine crossing the prairie alone as a pioneer or in a rocket circling the Earth. That always left me in awe. 
But I was unhappily alone at school, where I had no friends. People didn't talk to me unless forced by circumstances and the teacher. And then they would run screaming that they needed to wash their hands because I had given them cooties. (Good training for you today, dear classmates.)
When I was older, I found glorious alone time again, driving across Texas late at night, pulling over to look at the million stars. Trying again to imagine being up there looking down. Only it turned into terrifying alone time when a flasher began to stalk me one late night on the empty Texas highways. 
Still, I had gotten a taste for alone . When some years later I decided to try Quaker meeting at the Friends Meeting of Washington, I accidentally showed up an hour early. I sat alone in the meeting room looking at the plain pale green walls for nearly an hour before others came in, finding seats far away from me so as not to disturb my meditation. I was new at it and didn't understand, really, and was beginning to feel I should leave when an older woman sat right next to me without a word and I felt her calmness wrap around me. I never felt alone at meeting again. 
Another good alone was in the middle of a courtroom. I was at the lectern facing a panel of judges for the first time. I stood alone and confident. As far as I was concerned, I was the center of the world - until the judges started asking questions. And then some of the thrill was gone! 
Even someone like me who can savor alone time has times that are darker because of being alone . The night of my husband's death at home, the hours after my last friends and in-laws had left were some of my darkest and loneliest, and I keenly felt the pain side of alone . 
Still later, after having seen the twin towers fall on television, driving to downtown with my sister, then a Washington Post reporter, and seeing the plume rise up from the Pentagon from my office window, I felt somewhat heartened by the others standing with me those few days. Until a few nights later, when my house trembled from the engines of low-flying planes crossing the District sky for hours in the dark. Leaving me trembling in bed, wondering if it were the end of time. 
But, fortunately, it does not stay dark forever. 
A few years later, I walked away from my young son and his two friends and another adult, and savored a moment alone in Old Town Square in Prague. Just a few minutes, but a foretaste of traveling by myself in the future. I could taste it. 
And then I got to experience it, driving across the United States with a bald eagle swooping my car. Standing in the middle of a field of corn, gazing at the giant surreal power wind mills. I was undaunted by a flat tire. 
I flew to Kenya and spent time with Friends and then with my son until it was time for me to go to Western Kenya alone . I landed at the small airport with no cash and no cellphone minutes, because I was to be met by a student from the Friends seminary where I was to give lectures. No one greeted me. I waited an hour. Two hours. Four hours. 
I had arrived at 11 and it was now 3 and in Western Kenya at 6 p.m. when the sun sets there is no help to be found. I began to panic after hours of telling myself I would be picked up any minute. I went to the cab stand to talk to a cabdriver. She heard my story and agreed if no one came by 5 she would give me the 30- minute ride to the seminary - with the understanding she would be well paid there. I walked back to the terminal, glad that I had made a plan that would probably work. I looked up and there was a young man with the school uniform on.
The sound of a driving rain brings my mind back to my isolation at home. There is no one walking in the alley outside my window. There is no one in the house across the alley. I miss my sister, my friends, my postcard writing parties. My son - most of all. 
I feel sad and frustrated. 
But alone is not the end. Things are beginning to open up and I could seek company elsewhere. 
Then I think of the young doctor I have been making scrub booties and masks for, and how she said, ""I am so tired"" last week. Me being alone , even for many more days, to take a small part of her burden is a good alone .

158,"Interns Seek Solutions to Isolation During the Summer of Coronavirus; Halfway through their internships, young workers are sending signals that more communication makes all the alone time more manageable","Katie Garceran was playing a game of virtual Pictionary with other interns in the Washington, D.C.-based Fund for American Studies internship program from her apartment in Boone, N.C. Suddenly the game screen went black for five minutes. 
The energy was weird at first as everyone waited for the coordinator to fix the issue. After they scrapped the game for the night, what started as a silent guessing game of who would unmute themselves first ended as an opportunity for everyone to share details about their internship experiences so far. 
It was a moment that made the 21-year-old Ms. Garceran feel less alone . 
""It's a little bit awkward, kind of tentative at first. But it's exciting once people start talking and try to get to know each other,"" Ms. Garceran says. 
Halfway through this most virtual summer, one thing's certain: Many interns crave a greater sense of unity to help them feel like they're not in this alone . Managers report that interns are requesting additional communication and events that allow them to get to know each other informally. Those running virtual summer internships that are now halfway over are still figuring out how to make the interns feel less isolated. 
As employers shift to remote work, about 53% of students said they were most concerned about feelings of solitude on the job, according to market research firm Propeller Insights, which surveyed 1,003 college students on behalf of college career site Handshake in late June.
At Ford Motor Co., more than 600 interns spent the past few weeks participating in activities meant to help them forge relationships. During one session, some spent half an hour socializing and the other half testing their Ford knowledge in hopes of scoring a mystery prize. 
Intern Kristina Nunez, who logs on from home in Ann Arbor, Mich., enjoys using this time to learn about what the other interns have in common. She wishes the company would set up more events like this. 
""There's been a lot of opportunities to talk to full-time employees or recent college graduates and hear their take on the company or what they're doing, but my team doesn't immediately have another intern , so I can't really bounce ideas off of them or hear what they're doing,"" says Ms. Nunez, 22. 
Ford U.S. talent acquisition and onboarding lead Lena Allison has gotten this feedback a lot in recent weeks. The company has planned more events that bring interns together to hang out, such as small groups where interns can use gift cards from the company to buy sundaes and get to know each other.

At Amazon, which has more than 8,000 interns this year, interns knew about virtual events and networking opportunities, but were most interested in communicating with each other and their teams, Brett Saks, director of student programs at Amazon, says. 
The solution interns wanted didn't involve any complicated technology, Mr. Saks says. It was as simple as having coordinators help them set up chat rooms for an intern class that large. 
It's important to reassess how often people are communicating and what kind of technology is most efficient, says David Caffo, executive vice president of Cooperative Education & Internship Association. That could mean making a monthly intern social event happen weekly instead, or having check-ins with managers happen via phone call instead of instant message. 
In some cases, uncertainty surrounding proper communication protocols and structure has caused some new employees to feel anxious. Making those structures as explicit as possible is key, says Priti Khare, a spokeswoman at Handshake. 
Anna Blair Poulson, 21, interns remotely for 25 hours a week at Washington Life, a luxury lifestyle publication in Washington, D.C. The free rein she has over her hours gives her the flexibility to work from 9 to 5, or whenever inspiration strikes, so long as she gets her work done on time .

But even though she fights the temptation to sleep in, emails her mentor constantly and keeps a running to -do list to stay focused, sometimes she's unsure when she should be near her email and when it's OK to step away. 
""It's very important for me to stay on top of my emails and my to -do list to make sure I'm not dropping the ball on anything, since I don't have a supervisor walking by my desk and asking for progress updates,"" she says.
Microsoft intern Olaseni Adeniji looked forward to soaking up the company's culture and joining his colleagues on Intern Day, an annual event that rewards interns with swag, food and surprise music performances. Pitbull, Ella Mai and Julia Michaels have performed there in recent years. Instead, the 21- year-old's dreams of the Redmond, Wash., campus were replaced with the house he shares with his brother's family in Laurel, Md. 
Mr. Adeniji says he appreciates the company's efforts this summer. Still, he says, ""Regardless of how good everything is, it's really not going to be like that physical experience, you know?"" 
The sense of how well you're doing that comes from employers seeing your hard work firsthand gets lost while doing remote work, says Dan Cable, a professor at London Business School whose research focuses on employee engagement and organizational culture. 
Employees may feel pressure to show their commitment in other ways, even if it means spending extra hours at the computer in an effort to produce impressive work since the employer can't look over their shoulder so often. 
Mr. Adeniji says he sometimes loses track of how many hours he sits at his computer checking emails from senior employees before he pulls himself away so as not to burn himself out. 
It's incumbent on employers to make sure interns don't feel like they're on call and expected to work beyond their allotted number of hours, Ms. Khare says. 
""Make sure you make your expectations explicit, so that you're not experiencing burnout and your new employees aren't overwhelmed,"" she says. 
5 Ways to Improve Remote Internships 
1) Consider how often you have activities and events. If get-togethers only happen once a month, it's likely that interns still won't know each other well. Finding a more consistent rhythm could make it easier to get past the awkward phase and more into fun. 
2) Form small groups or teams. While large groups can be overwhelming at times , smaller groups can make virtual calls easier and allow deeper discussions where everyone has more time to talk and feel included. Group projects can also give interns a chance to work with and learn from each other. 
3) Encourage one-on-one check-ins among interns . It's important to network with employees in the company. That should include other interns . 
4) Create chat rooms where interns can get to know each other. Not every meeting point has to be via video call. It can be helpful to know others are around during the day, ready to offer on-the -spot advice or share informal thoughts in casual conversation. 
5) Make communication and scheduling protocols clear. If interns have flexibility to make their own hours, be specific on expectations so that they aren't on standby or working overtime to meet them.",7/13/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,2,1
161,Adopting a pet may help reader cope with isolation,"Dear Amy: Not long before the pandemic started, I moved across the country. I've tried staying in touch with people where I used to live, and I spent about six months in my new home getting out and about and meeting people. I created a few acquaintances, but that's it so far. I've tried suggesting video or phone chats, but people I know (in both places) aren't able to/interested in more than texting to keep in touch. The past three months have been isolating, and I have a health condition that puts me at high risk, so I don't see an end in sight without a vaccine. There's not really any way to make new friends while staying at home, so how do I deal with texting being my only form of contact for the next year or so? 
- Isolated 
Isolated: I certainly hope it won't be a year before you are able to move around with a feeling of safety concerning your health. A year is a very long time to be isolated from most human contact. 
My first recommendation is for you to adopt a pet, if you are able and if your health allows. Shelters are offering adoptions via appointment, and if there is a way for you to do this safely, I hope you will consider it. 
Many people who are still working (remotely) are completely exhausted with videoconferencing. What seemed like a fun novelty four months ago (Zoom cocktails, cool!) now feels forced. 
Texting is not an optimal way to stay in touch, but if you put some effort into becoming an engaging correspondent (not initiating too often, being responsive to others, and occasionally sending fun memes and videos), texting can be a somewhat satisfying way of staying connected. 
You could also see if your hometown friends might want to create a standing date to play an online game such as ""Words With Friends.""
Understand, however, that many people are struggling right now - just as you are. What I'm trying to say is - it's not you. It is everyone. 
Your local library might host a (virtual) book club you could join. Doing this would help you to connect in person when the world opens up. 
Yes - you can make new friends while staying at home. There are numerous online communities for any interest you might have - or acquire. Reddit.com is (basically) the Internet's bulletin board. I just randomly looked up ""Portland/knitting"" and felt instantly cheered by the photos and comments of knitters in Portland. (And I don't knit - OR live in Portland!) 
Dear Amy: I am retired. I never married and have no children. Thanks to the careful budgeting of my parents and an uncle, I am what would be called comfortably well off. Now that I have the time and my health, I have indulged in traveling. If all goes well, I'm planning a trip to Europe later this year. I offered all three of my nieces a chance to go with me. All three turned me down for good reasons, so it looks like I am going by myself. My brother called me and asked me how it was that I can afford to take the kids to Europe and not help him with other bills. I am likely to get overburdened with his bills, and I didn't feel comfortable signing a loan for him. My brother told me that I was not to have anything to do with his kids. I am a consenting adult who can decide for myself who I will and won't associate with . Furthermore, all three nieces are consenting adults and can make their own decisions. I'd love to hear your take on the situation. - -Loving Aunt 
Loving Aunt: I'm volunteering to be your ""companion,"" like a character in an E.M. Forster novel.

162,Lonely Girls: How the Pandemic Has Deepened the Isolation of Adolescents; The coronavirus lockdown has increased the fear of missing out for many girls; social media reveals who's getting together and who's stuck at home,"Emerson Christman's family has been strict about social distancing during the pandemic , so she keeps tabs on her friends via group texts. PHOTO: Bryan Anselm for The Wall Street Journal 
Emerson Christman hasn't gotten together with friends in four months because of the coronavirus pandemic . The loneliness is gnawing at her. 
""It's really hard not to see my friends. When you're a 10-year-old, that's all you care about,"" she said. ""I hate it, really."" 
Emerson's family has been more stringent about socially isolating than many of her friends' families. Seeing her friends plan get-togethers over group texts has only magnified the loneliness. 
""I'm not upset with my friends because I know they're excited about seeing each other. I'm annoyed with my situation because we're deciding not to see anyone,"" she said. ""It's hard to make the best of it because there's not much to do and it's just a lot of family time, which is nice and not nice at the same time."" 
Emerson said she cries a lot because she feels like she's the only one not seeing friends. 
Her mother, Erin Christman, feels helpless. ""I try not to tell her how much harder this is for people who have lost jobs or relatives because I know for her and her 10-year-old world this is really hard,"" Ms. Christman said. ""I try to listen and validate her feelings and let her vent and yell and cry.""
As alone as Emerson feels, she has quite a bit of company. A recent nationwide study found that 78% of fifth- through eight-grade girls feel more lonely and isolated since the pandemic began. The same is true of older teens. 
The study, conducted in May by the Rox Institute for Research & Training, the research arm of Ruling Our eXperiences, a nonprofit focused on girls , also found that of the younger girls in that study—ages 10 to 14 —a third are spending four or more hours a day on social media , primarily on TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram. 
All that time on social media is contributing to the loneliness, said Lisa Hinkelman, the nonprofit's founder and CEO. ""They were all in this together a few months ago when no one was allowed to be out and about, but now, with changing state restrictions and some families being more permissive about allowing sleepovers and trips, they can feel like they're the only ones stuck at home ,"" she said. 
""It's not just the fear of missing out, it's the actual missing out,"" Dr. Hinkelman added. 
Adolescent girls already were experiencing record-high levels of loneliness, anxiety and depression before the pandemic , according to Mary Pipher, a clinical psychologist and author of ""Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls ."" She and her daughter documented the many reasons underlying the increased loneliness—spending more time online and less time in person with friends, among them—in an essay in The Wall Street Journal last August . 
""All of the things that a year ago were increasing girls ' depression have been exacerbated by the pandemic ,"" Dr. Pipher told me. ""Our recommendations were that girls spend more time with other girls , that they spend more time outside the home and that parents encourage girls to take more risks in order to develop skills on their own. Most of those things aren't happening now because of Covid."" 
Spending more time on social media and less face-to-face time with friends can be harmful to girls in this critical developmental stage, Dr. Pipher said. For younger girls , whose parents don't yet allow them to have social media accounts, texting is the communication tool of choice, and it's a poor replacement for actual phone calls, Dr. Pipher said. ""Girls are together but alone."" 
Shortly after Emerson's school closed in March, she and her family went from their home in Wyckoff, N.J., to Columbus, Ohio, to quarantine with her maternal grandparents. During that time, Emerson's mother was busy helping the two younger siblings with remote school. Emerson was more self-sufficient and completed her school work before they did. With nothing else to do, she filled her bonus time by watching YouTube and texting friends on her iPad. 
The Christman family—Sawyer, Stefan, Emerson, Harper and Erin—are back home in New Jersey after quarantining with relatives in other states. . PHOTO: Bryan Anselm for The Wall Street Journal 
Prior to the pandemic , she was allowed to text only her grandparents and uncles, but she asked if she could add her best friend to her contacts list. Pretty soon a whole group of friends was texting. And where Emerson used to ask permission to watch certain YouTube videos, she began more freely streaming content unsupervised. 
""I had control of the iPad use before the quarantine and I felt it slowly getting away from me,"" Ms. Christman said. She didn't do much to stop it, though, because it was Emerson's only connection to friends.
Kids' screen usage has soared during the pandemic and many kids have bypassed parental controls in an effort to get more screen time and escape the social isolation and boredom. Boys also feel lonely and have been seeking social connection with friends during this period, often through videogames. But in a survey conducted by Common Sense Media in the spring, far more teenage girls reported feeling more lonely than usual. 
In June, the Christmans returned home to New Jersey for a few weeks before visiting Emerson's other set of grandparents in Maine. Emerson's paternal grandmother is Italian. The toll Covid-19 took on Italy intensified the family's reaction. ""My mother-in-law was watching her whole country fall apart,"" Ms. Christman said. 
The Christmans feel pressure to isolate for the sake of the paternal grandparents, who live near them in New Jersey part of the year. Many families around the country are now having similarly difficult conversations about social distancing . 
""The grandparents have said that being with them will look different—if we see them at all—if we start to allow the kids to get together with others,"" Ms. Christman said. ""I don't know that we'll be able to sit inside with them at the dinner table like we have been or run and hug them if we start getting together with other people."" 
Nevertheless, Ms. Christman added, ""I don't want Emerson to feel like she has to make a choice between her grandparents and her friends."" 
Emerson isn't sure if she'll even see her friends when school resumes. Her family hasn't yet decided if she will attend school virtually or in person. Emerson and her friends would normally be busy talking about their coming school year by now, but they're instead talking about what middle school might be like a year from now. 
""That's what most of our FaceTime calls are about. It's really nice to talk to my friends because they understand that,"" she said.

164,Losing a grandma in the alone times,"The FaceTime call seemed like an easy way to introduce my new cat to my grandmother, homebound in her Maryland nursing home during the pandemic. 
She sat in a room designated for video calls, bright lights illuminating her face. I was 900 miles away, sitting at the breakfast table in my childhood home with my parents and boyfriend. 
“Meet Lola,” I said to her, thrusting my 8-pound cat in front of the tiny cell phone camera. She smiled knowingly. 
“Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets,” she replied. 
We all chuckled. She was still yiayia, a little sassy and never afraid to speak up, even as she adjusted her hearing aids or laughed in a way that revealed she didn’t quite understand everything that was going on. 
I didn’t know that would be the last time I’d talk to my yiayia. I guess you never do. I was shocked when I heard the news. No matter a loved one’s age, their death always deals a blow. 
My second thought was the sad realization of how the coronavirus pandemic would interfere in my family’s grieving process. Normally, my grandmother would have had a large funeral with family and friends. We would have had a luncheon followed by each of us sharing stories from her full life. Coming together would have soothed the pain, even if just for a while.
She deserved more than a prayer service over Zoom, random family members cutting in and out as they forgot to put their audio on mute. 
My yiayia was the archetypal Greek matriarch. Sundays were spent at her and my grandfather’s house. The whole family gathered for large brunches that devolved into loud clapping in front of the TV over football games and me and dad playing pinball. 
I remember the food, the heaping platters of spanakopita and tiropita, the trays of sliced feta. Whenever we walked into the house, I’d ask if she had made any spinach or cheese pie that day. She would laugh because most kids don’t beg for spinach. (To those kids, I say: You haven’t had spanakopita.) 
She was so vibrant. Leaving any gathering with her took forever — there were so many goodbyes and always another person to kiss on the cheek. On visits to Florida, she and my papou would stay up until the wee hours of the night, sitting at the coffee table 
and laughing, their voices carrying through the house, turning over old memories once more. I would sit in my bed, preparing for the next day of high school, wondering how me, the teenager, was more tired than my 80-something grandparents. 
She was also fiercely competitive. She and my papou once got into a heated argument over a game of Monopoly. When I repeated this story to my mom recently, she reminded me that it wasn’t even traditional Monopoly that had started the storied fight. It was the cat-themed spinoff, Cat-opoly. 
She absolutely thrived on social interaction. No one had so many friends. She was a part of a bowling league for as long as she could manage and played bridge with her friends for years. My grandfather and her were attached at the hip until his death more than seven years ago. So I worried how all that time alone would impact her. 
I also worried about the physical threat of the virus itself, knowing how fast it can spread in enclosed places. People had died from COVID-19 at my yiayia’s nursing home. But when all the residents were tested, she came back negative. I knew the virus could strike again, but it felt like we were in the clear, at least for a while. It felt like we had more time . 
My yiayia frequently told my dad that she worried she’d never see him again. When I learned that detail after her death, I let myself cry for the first time . 
The image of her sitting alone in a room, confused, worrying whether she would ever see her children again — it seemed the worst kind of torture. 
My yiayia didn’t die of coronavirus. She died of natural causes, of being 95, of living a full life, of closing her eyes one night and not opening them the next morning. 
But I wonder how much the isolation weighed on her. I wonder how much she understood. I wonder how afraid she was, how alone she must have felt. 
I know I’m not the only one who feels this way. As the pandemic stretches on, many of us will lose someone we love, from COVID-19 or something else, and grapple with what it is to grieve in this new world.
I’m not sure I’ve fully confronted it yet. There’s a deep sense of unfairness I feel with losing a grandmother and not being able to honor her properly. 
What I am trying to do now is take her memory with me throughout parts of my daily life and cherish her in my actions. I feel that’s all I can do, given the circumstances. After all, a funeral, luncheon and formal burial are just a way of expressing grief in public. And unfortunately, once they are done, the grief still remains.",8/9/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,neither,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,1
165,Coronavirus Turmoil Raises Depression Risks in Young Adults; Social isolation and vanished opportunities caused by Covid-19 bring a mental-health toll for those on the cusp of careers and adulthood,"The social isolation brought by the Covid - 19 pandemic has made everything harder, says Da'Trevion Moss, a senior at the University of Dubuque. PHOTO: Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal 
For Da'Trevion Moss, a 23-year-old college student at the University of Dubuque in Iowa, the Covid - 19 pandemic has dealt a series of personal blows. His summer internship at a local hospital was canceled. Many of his plans for starting an on -campus chapter of Active Minds, a young adult mental - health - advocacy organization, had to be shelved. And now he's anxious about going back to in -person classes as the virus continues to spread. 
""I felt like my career, all the things I was looking forward to and planning, were all ruined,"" says Mr. Moss, who is starting his senior year and goes by Tre. ""I was hurt and devastated by that."" The social isolation has made everything harder, he says. ""I really thrive off face-to-face interactions. Not having that for the past four or five months has been really, really difficult."" 
The pandemic and its economic fallout are taking a toll on the mental health of many Americans. But the burden is perhaps greatest for those on the brink of adulthood , young people who are often seeing their dreams of careers , romances and adventures dashed. 
Mr. Moss says he's trying to keep a positive mindset, going to the gym and getting back his old job at Starbucks when his internship fell through. On his frequent walks, he often stops to pet his neighbor's dog. PHOTO: Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal
""A number of kids are expressing that these are supposed to be the best years—high school and college— the most free years,"" says Anne Marie Albano, a professor of medical psychology in psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York. ""The possibility that Covid is going to completely change this period of their life, and they won't ever get it back, is overwhelming for a lot of them,"" she says. 
Nearly 41% of college students reported symptoms of depression in a survey of 18,764 students from the end of March through May by the American College Health Association and the Healthy Minds Network, a research project based at the University of Michigan, Boston University and the University of California, Los Angeles. That is up from 35.7% in a Healthy Minds survey from fall 2019. Also, suicide risk measured in the spring ticked up to 27.2%, from 25% measured last fall in a survey by the college health association, which is a research and advocacy group promoting student health. In a survey taken in April by Active Minds—which has chapters on more than 550 college campuses—about 80% of 2,086 college students reported that Covid - 19 had ""negatively impacted"" their mental health . 
Even before the pandemic, young people showed rising rates of mental - health problems. According to a spring 2019 survey of nearly 68,000 college students by the American College Health Association, about 24% had been diagnosed with or treated for anxiety problems in the preceding 12 months, and 20% had been diagnosed with or treated for depression . Those rates were about double those found in the survey a decade earlier. The stress of Covid can make existing mental - health problems worse and cause new ones, psychologists say. 
""Emerging adulthood is a very intense time of life,"" says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a senior research scholar at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. From the ages of roughly 18 to 29, young people ""are making big decisions about their education, their career path, their romantic relationships,"" Dr. Arnett says. ""It's the liftoff decade for your entry to an adult career path. To have that suddenly blown up with no sign of when it's going to end, it's tough."" 
Sophia Shieh, who is 21 and entering her junior year at Boston College, applied for three summer internships. They were all canceled, as was her summer work-study job. Perhaps the biggest blow, however, was the cancellation of her study-abroad program in Oxford, England, where she had planned to spend the coming school year. 
""I was really sad,"" says Ms. Sheih, who says she has found solace in online support groups run by her college's counseling center and in a virtual Bible study group she conducts with friends. 
Psychologists say that the social isolation and the curtailing of some autonomy imposed by the pandemic are particularly difficult for teenagers and young adults . At these ages, young people are driven to seek more independence from their families, connect with their peers and pursue romantic relationships, says Karen L. Bierman, director of the Child Study Center at Pennsylvania State University. 
The uncertainty around if and when the pandemic will end, and what life will look like in that future, is also causing distress. 
""One of the things that carries young people through all of the things they have to do is some vision of the future. Here's a life I see for myself that looks interesting. Suddenly that gets hard to see,"" says Joseph P. Allen, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia. Dr. Allen says this can zap motivation to do things like study for the SAT or even just get off the sofa, which can make mental - health issues even worse.
The grinding unemployment that has hit young people especially hard is likely to have other harmful effects, notes Charles B. Nemeroff, professor and chair of the department of psychiatry at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. ""Studies have shown a relationship between unemployment and suicide and unemployment and illicit drug use and unemployment and alcohol use. This teenage and young - adult population is particularly susceptible to those influences,"" Dr. Nemeroff says. 
Indeed, psychologists and psychiatrists worry that the pandemic may cause long-term harm because the developing brain is ""vulnerable to insults,"" he says. ""One of the insults is isolation and loneliness."" 
""One of the key jobs that a teenager has developmentally is to learn how to develop trusting friendships and resolve conflicts in ways that are constructive and productive,"" says Maria A. Oquendo, chairman of psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and past president of the American Psychiatric Association. Social isolation could ""derail their maturation and development,"" Dr. 
Oquendo says. 
Several psychologists recommend that teens and young adults create ""pods"" with a few friends they can see without social distancing. The key is to allow young people to meet their needs for social interaction in a safe way, says Columbia's Dr. Albano. ""If you pen them in ,"" she says, ""you're going to make your kids more depressed and anxious."" (They'll also be more likely to sneak out to those big, unsupervised parties, she adds.) 
Focusing on what you can control helps, says Mary Alvord, a psychologist in Chevy Chase, Md. ""Every session, I start with, 'What's under your control right now, what's going well?' And when things are not going well, 'What are aspects you can do something about?' "" 
James Robinson, 15, says volunteering with an organization that delivers food to needy families and attending protests for the Black Lives Matter movement ""adds structure and gives me a boost in myself."" A high-school sophomore this year in Bethesda, Md., James says, ""Doing something I'm passionate about that's doing some good in the world, that's important to me."" 
The pandemic might be teaching some young adults an important lesson, says Victor Schwartz, a psychiatrist and chief medical officer at the Jed Foundation, a mental - health -education and advocacy group focusing on young adults . Covid - 19 , says Dr. Schwartz, ""has undermined the fantasy that I think teens and young adults and their families have had, that life is controllable and predictable given the right resources."" Young people, Dr. Schwartz says, can ""learn how to adjust and roll with things."" 
Mr. Moss in Iowa says what has been helping him is sticking to a schedule. He has started going to the gym every day, writing poetry and heading out for regular walks. He sees a therapist weekly and, after his internship fell through, got his old job back at Starbucks.

166,NASSAU COUNTY: WRITE STUFF: TECHNOLOGY HELPS MAKE PEN PALS OF STUDENTS AND SENIORS LIVING IN ISOLATION,"When Steven Schwartz heard of writing letters to seniors in nursing homes as a pen pal , he thought of an uncle on the autism spectrum who lives in a group home. 
""For months, we weren't able to see him,"" said Schwartz, 14. ""I could only imagine how hard it must have been for certain people to be contained like that for months. So I felt like the least I can do is to reach out through a pen pal program."" 
Schwartz, who lives in Roslyn, is one of about 60 students participating in a pen pal program created by Clara Pomerantz, an East Hills Village trustee and a preschool teacher. Her goal was to connect children and teenagers - plus interested adults - with nursing home residents to fight the social  isolation brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  
The letter exchange via email was born out of Pomerantz's ""Made You Smile!"" program, which has allowed children to send cards and pictures electronically to nursing homes since April. 
""When the pandemic started to get worse, I wanted to make it a little more personal,"" said Pomerantz, who added the pen pal service in June. 
With the help of Zach Gerson, 15, Pomerantz has facilitated hundreds of letters in which the correspondents discussed their hobbies, childhoods and the pandemic. 
""I can't imagine what it is like to be living in a nursing home during these tough times. How have you been coping?"" Lucas Weisser wrote last month to Angela Miller, a resident at Townhouse Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in Uniondale. ""My school stopped in March. It was online from March until June when school
ended. Since then I have not had much to do."" 
With the help of staffers, Miller, 62, wrote back Tuesday on an iPad that she had to help keep herself busy since March. She told Weisser she loves music and dancing in her chair. The sports fan roots for the NFL's New Orleans Saints, NASCAR driver Kyle Busch and the New York Yankees. 
""I thought it was cool that she liked sports because I also like sports,"" said Weisser, 14, of Roslyn, adding that he plans to write back to tell Miller that he's also a Yankees fan. 
Stephanie Datys, director of therapeutic recreation at Townhouse, which has seven residents participating in the program, said the letters make the recipients feel special and serve as a link to the outside world. 
""Even though they are isolated in here, the kids that are writing them are also isolated because they were quarantined at home when schools first closed,"" Datys said. ""Even though they have nothing in common, they had that one thing in common."" 
In mid-June, Sloane Simon, 14, of East Hills, felt like she was trapped at home. She had just finished eighth grade at her school in Roslyn. Weeks earlier she learned the summer camp in Massachusetts she had attended for seven years was canceled. 
Simon said she was disappointed, bored and missed her friends. Then she heard about the pen pal program from her mother, Stacey, and wrote her first letter June 21. 
""It's something I look forward to,"" Simon said. ""It makes me feel happy that I can make someone else feel happy and uplifted, especially during these times when they are isolated.""",8/14/20,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4
169,Tweens vs. loneliness: How to fight isolation in the pandemic,"For most adolescents, the pandemic has turned their social lives upside down. 
""Since the quarantine began, my 12-year-old daughter, Penelope, hasn't had a normal playdate,"" says Megan Malone, of Petaluma, Calif. After social distancing for months, Malone says her daughter misses her friends and longs to see them in person. 
While tweens often text and play online games such as Roblox and Minecraft, virtual communication can't replace the intimacy of seeing friends in real life. 
""Penelope loves acting and musical theater,"" Malone says. ""Video chats are no substitute."" 
""I miss giving my friends hugs,"" Vivienne Cornwall, 11, says. The tween is keeping in touch with her friends via Zoom and Houseparty. 
""Interactions like talking to friends at sports practice and meeting pals at camp give tweens a sense of belonging,"" says Suniya Luthar, a psychologist and chief researcher at Authentic Connections, a nonprofit committed to fostering resilience in schools. Without those experiences, they may feel sad and lonely. 
Research published in June found that lonely adolescents may be at a higher risk for mental illness, even after the pandemic ends. The researchers reviewed 63 studies that examined the effect of social isolation and loneliness on the psychological well-being of tweens . 
""Our analysis found that prolonged loneliness may make adolescents more prone to anxiety or depression in the future,"" says Maria Loades, a clinical psychologist at the University of Bath and lead author of the paper. She says lonesome tweens may feel flawed and unlikeable, which may prevent them from reaching
out to their peers. 
Other studies have found that loneliness may make adolescents more susceptible to Internet addiction, eating disorders and academic difficulties. Another recent study published in Personality and Individual Differences journal found that lonely tweens often grapple with irritability, anger and self-blame. 
Adolescents often interpret their lonely feelings to mean that their friends don't like them, says Lele Diamond, a psychologist in San Francisco who counsels tweens . ""It's hard for them to realize that having a 'bad feeling' doesn't mean they are a 'bad person,' "" she says. 
Studies show close friendships can help tweens weather loneliness . And researchers say adolescents with positive friendships are better at coping with adversity, disappointment and trauma later in life. For some, these bonds can be just as valuable as family support. 
""As tweens loosen ties to their parents, they depend more on friends for guidance,"" says psychologist Lisa Damour, author of ""Under Pressure: Confronting the Epidemic of Stress and Anxiety in Girls."" ""Friendships give kids a place to share their worries with peers who make them feel connected and accepted."" 
But as coronavirus cases surge, it's unknown whether in -person school will resume in the fall in many districts. Vivienne, who lives in San Francisco, will not resume in -person learning on the first day of school in August. The San Francisco Unified School District won't resume in -person classes in the fall. 
If schools remain closed, tweens will miss out on feel-good connections such as eating lunch with friends and talking to them after class. ""In the absence of those meetings, it's vital for young people to have social support to ease loneliness and build social skills,"" Loades says. 
Here's how parents and other caregivers can help. 
Find new social networks 
As social distancing continues, some tweens may connect with peers outside of their pre- pandemic social circles because it eases their frustration. ""These friends don't remind them of what they're missing,"" Damour says. 
Reinstating relationships with neighbors or talking to friends who moved away can help tweens form new bonds. Finding creative ways to interact with loved ones can also be beneficial. 
Jamie Beth Cohen's tween daughter, Nora Schindler, 11, started a singalong on Facebook Live. Cohen, who lives in Lancaster, Pa., says Nora loves singing and chooses different themes for each singalong, such as ""Broadway songs by women singer/songwriters."" 
""Friends and family watch the singalong, and it's an excellent way for Nora to keep in touch and share her hobby with them,"" Cohen says. 
During the delicate tween years, however, not every kid is eager to socialize. ""Shy and anxious tweens may have a harder time reaching out because they're afraid of being rejected or ridiculed,"" Luthar says. 
For those children, group activities that involve classmates may lessen insecurity. Parents could organize an online activity such as game night or host ""caring committees"" to plan safe outdoor gatherings and get togethers for the school community. ""Whatever parents choose, the goal is to foster closeness and
community,"" Luthar says. 
Choose a new hobby 
""Taking up a new hobby can be a useful way to combat loneliness ,"" Loades says. Studies point out that hobbies can lessen stress and bolster well-being. Shared activities can also serve as social glue, which can help tweens cultivate new relationships. 
New hobbies might include taking an online art class or baking with friends via FaceTime. Musically inclined tweens may enjoy writing songs or playing instruments with friends via Zoom. Some may enjoy writing short stories, poetry or create a product of their own. 
""During the lockdown, Penelope developed an interest in skin care,"" Malone says. The tween transformed her bedroom into a spa called "" The Pink Pearl."" 
""Penelope decorated her at-home spa with candles and wrote up a menu of services,"" Malone says. Before long, she started making facial masks and lotions. 
""We've dropped off samples to her friends,"" Malone says. ""It's been a fun way for Penelope to explore a new interest and do something kind for others."" 
Maintain an open dialogue 
Often, it's painful for parents and other caregivers to witness their tween's loneliness and suffering, especially when life feels unpredictable, unsafe and out of control. In hopes of easing distress, the adults may advise their tween to adopt a positive attitude or tell them that social distancing isn't that bad. 
Such words are meant to provide comfort, but they may come across as invalidating. Damour says parents shouldn't try to fix their child's emotions, because doing so might not be possible. Instead, she suggests broaching the conversation with: ""You seem upset. What's up?"" 
Inviting tweens to share what's on their mind conveys empathy and shows that tough conversations are okay, Damour says. In addition, open-ended questions encourage tweens to brainstorm solutions, which can be empowering and spark self-confidence. In the end, these problem-solving qualities can benefit them for years to come.",8/18/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,1
172,Why colleges can't keep the virus out; Students are in the age group most distressed by pandemic isolation.,"As a college professor, I am very worried about more colleges and universities opening around the country over the next few weeks. If campus communities can't comply with social distancing requirements, thousands of students could contract COVID-19, forcing schools to scramble to shut down again and go fully remote. 
Quite a few schools that have opened -- with safety protocols in place -- have already either closed or are struggling to deal with coronavirus spikes. Cases have been reported at colleges and universities in 36 states, including Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Iowa, Alabama, Massachusetts and Mississippi. And fingers are being pointed at students for being irresponsible and dangerous for violating social distancing rules in the midst of this pandemic . 
At Syracuse University in New York, for instance, the county executive admonished students for gathering in a big group on campus, calling them ""boneheaded"" and stating, ""we are very disappointed in the choices these kids have made."" The university's vice chancellor called the students ' behavior ""selfish and unsettling."" 
In Minnesota, the president of St. Olaf College , a liberal arts college , called students at his school ""reckless"" for gathering at an off-campus party that exposed students to the coronavirus before campus housing even opened. 
Without a doubt, there will be more such examples over the next few weeks. It is important to understand why college students -- members of Generation Z, born after 1996 -- are taking risks to socialize despite all the guidelines. They are well aware of the dangers of COVID-19, but they are also in the age group most
deeply affected by the social isolation of the pandemic and experience greater loneliness compared with older Americans. 
It's not surprising that college students would be desperate to be with their friends, even if that means ignoring COVID-19 rules. Unless college and university administrators recognize and address these social needs directly -- and find outlets for social activities both in person and virtually -- exhorting students to follow the rules is unlikely to work. 
Data from the AEI COVID-19 and American Life Survey in June found that 61% of Gen Zers said they felt lonely a few times a week or more often. No other age group approached this level of loneliness -- for millennials in their mid-20s to late 30s , it was 48%; for Gen Xers, in their 40s and early 50s, it was 35%; and for baby boomers, it was just 25%. 
Feelings of depression and anxiety reveal a similar pattern. A report this month from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 46% of people between the ages of 18 and 24 reported mental health disorders related to the pandemic , compared with 36% for people age 25-44, 17% for those 45-64, and 9% for people 65 and older. 
Such generational differences were found even before the pandemic , with people under 30 saying they felt more isolated than older people. What is particularly noteworthy is the intra- group change caused by the pandemic . Young people seem to be experiencing it differently and more painfully than their parents and grandparents. 
In 2018, 22% of baby boomers and 35% of Gen Xers reported feeling lonely on a regular basis -- and those numbers have stayed practically unchanged in recent survey results. By contrast, the percentage of Gen Zers reporting feelings of isolation rose from 52% in 2018 to 61% this year. 
Given this epidemic of loneliness, it is reasonable to think college students would want to attend campus gatherings to connect with others in person. Deeper research will have to be done on the pandemic 's long term effect on this group , and some are already seeing this moment as the start of an epidemic of depression with effects lasting possibly decades. 
College leaders need to be aware of this reality as they draw up guidelines for students returning to campus -- or they should keep the schools closed. They should anticipate that students will take risks to congregate. After all, until six months ago, college life was all about forming communities and doing things together. 
That's why it's important to come up with ways to help students work through COVID-19 loneliness and fill that social need -- such as with shared and safe activities like movies, music or entertainment in large, outdoor venues that can safely accommodate moderately large numbers along with offering innovative digital programming. 
As administrators push to resume residential campus life, they have to prevent transmission of the virus , but assigning blame and castigating students won't help. 
Reopening campuses during a pandemic is an enormous challenge, even when the vast majority of students live by the rules. Gen Zers are facing a mental health crisis, and empathy and support would go a long way in helping improve their outlook and behavior.",8/25/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3
173,How Isolation Hurts Elders: [Letter],"Re ""The Senior Facility Dilemma: Are Visitors Allowed?,"" by Paula Span (The New Old Age, Science Times, Aug. 18): 
I read with interest your article about the effects of isolation on elders in nursing facilities during the pandemic. I view my mother's recent death at age 96 as collateral damage from Covid-19. The lack of visitors during her facility's shutdown hastened her cognitive decline and her will to live after a fall. The facility where she lived was excellent and the staff was caring and dedicated, but that wasn't sufficient to compensate for lack of in-person family support. 
Perhaps we should rethink the trade-off between maximum protection of our elderly from a potentially deadly virus versus providing for their emotional needs at a stage in life when they are most vulnerable.",8/26/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
174,Intimacy in Isolation: [Style Desk],"My reflection shows a body I'm still unfamiliar with -- a shaved head, keloids slashing across my chest, a soft belly with a pale spill of hypopigmentation next to my navel. 
It's been two years since I slept with anyone, a stranger in London whose name I've forgotten. I don't want to be touched right now. It feels too invasive, hands on my skin, a hungry mouth. 
In the echo of isolation , I'm writing letters to my friends, confessing how I'm not sure I've ever been attracted to anyone -- not anyone real, not when the idea of them is what I want to be close to, what I want to touch. When you make a person unreal, are they still alive? 
Before the pandemic, I left a lover who used to fantasize about my corpse. It suited me back then, back when I wanted to be dead, a weight of heavy flesh gone cold, but still loved by someone who would take the time to arrange my limbs, angle my jaw, my stone of a head. I wish I could say I wanted him alive, but the closest thing to truth is that I wanted him animated, but not real. 
I wonder how far the distance is between making a person an object and making an object a person, the way station where someone can be both real and unreal at the same time. The other day, I researched male sex dolls, with their still eyes and soft mouths, their cold and plausible skin. I don't want to keep a corpse in my house, but I'd take a one-night stand with something that was sculpted to pass as an inanimate human. It makes little difference in the end, whether that body is flesh or silicone. Either way, I'd be alone.
If I lie naked in a bed with someone else, touching their body and seeing only the fantasy of them that I've created, are they even there? What if it's just me and my imagination, something I created on the scaffold of their flesh? What if I've just turned them into a proxy of myself? 
Maybe they're doing the same thing to me, making me a mirror. Maybe that's the unspoken contract: to be blank spaces for each other, holding the maps of desire that are projected on our skins, fingers lacing electric as they press against spines and shoulder blades. I often imagine the aesthetic of our bodies in proximity -- this dark warm skin, thick black hair, white teeth breaking apart in pleasure. 
Maybe we are alone together and that is a tender choice, to avert our gaze, to allow each other some privacy in the midst of such terrible intimacy . It can be unsettling to be seen. Maybe we are two dead things tangled up like chains, maybe we resurrect when we are apart. 
The other night, I was hallucinating wind chimes in my pulse, my blood singing to me from inside my head, pushing along, and I thought: How much closer could anyone get to me? My heartbeat was surging through my lower lip, pressed smudged and sleepy against the moss green linen of my bedsheet, and I was so deliciously alone, soft and untouched. Another pulse would have spoiled it. 
I have never spent this much time with myself; to become my own favorite companion is a new and strange thing for me. I was always looking for someone else, and now I'm terrified of finding them. Perhaps they don't exist outside of my imagination; I've never met a lover who could make all their own stories come true. 
I gave up on having a self and accepted that I've been unreal this whole time, a story even when I'm alone. 
After all, the worlds I make are better than the world we have. In my realities, we are transcendent and never cruel. There's no violence, only swaths of tenderness. We touch each other as if we were lost and then brought back to life; we face fear like we're already dead. 
I see unknown lovers in my dreams, they dance with their bodies close to mine and kiss me on airplanes cutting through a night sky. Maybe after the isolation ends, one of them will make themselves real enough to find me, and the idea of them will be the same as the flesh, which means they are like me, strong enough to live as a story and have it stay true. I would, I think, like to be touched then.

175,"Alice Koller, 94, Troubled Author of the Solitary Life: [Correction]","Her book, ""An Unknown Woman,"" has been compared to a feminist's Walden and has attracted fans inspired by her self-reckoning. 
At 37, Alice Koller was unsettled. She had a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard, a résumé of small-bore jobs in and out of academia and no fixed address. She was bright and educated, yet she had floundered. 
In the winter of 1962, she rented a house on Nantucket in Massachusetts, bought herself a German shepherd puppy and set out to interrogate her life . The stakes were high: As she later wrote, she was fully prepared to end it all should she not succeed. 
The book that recorded her experience, ""An Unknown Woman,"" was eventually published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston in 1982. It attracted devoted readers, who were inspired by Ms. Koller's self-reckoning -- a feminist's Walden. As her life was reduced to small essential acts -- making coffee, walking on the beach and caring for her puppy -- she found that they were enough to sustain her. 
""I know who I am a little bit more each day,"" she wrote. 
Ms. Koller died on July 21 in a hospital in Trenton, N.J., at 94 , a niece, Cherie Koller-Fox, said. She said she did not know the cause. 
In the years after she left Nantucket, Ms. Koller would continue to live on the margins. Ms. Koller-Fox said her aunt, estranged from her family, had rented in various places, including Ithaca, N.Y., and Washington, supported by modest gifts of money from friends and government assistance. (Her brother, Kenneth, died in 2018; her sister Muriel Cooper, in 2019.)
In 1977, Judy Flanders, a reporter for the now-closed newspaper The Washington Star, found Ms. Koller unemployed in Warrenton, Va., and deep in debt. She owed two months rent and lawyers fees for a suit she had pursued against an animal hospital when her German shepherd died in its care. She had sold her furniture to help pay down her debts. Ms. Flanders wrote an article about her. 
Over the years she had worked at Mademoiselle magazine, as a speechwriter, as a medical writer and as a teacher at the University of California, Santa Barbara, filling in for a few months for a professor on leave. 
As she wrote in ""An Unknown Woman,"" ""I was always working toward something, but I never, ever got there."" 
Alice Koller was born Sept. 13, 1925, in Akron, Ohio, to Andrew and Sarah Koller. Her father ran a hardware store, and her mother was a homemaker. Alice was valedictorian of her high school class; after graduating, she attended drama school at the Goodman Theater in Chicago and then the University of Chicago. 
It took eight years for her to get her doctorate in philosophy from Harvard in 1960 -- hard won as she labored to pass her exams after a medical leave. Her father, whom she adored, suffered from early onset Alzheimer's disease and was cared for at home by her mother, whom she resented, she said. 
When she completed her dissertation, she brought it to her father, already in the cloud of his disease, and placed it in his hands. As she wrote in her book, he said, ""I don't care about that,"" and pushed it away. 
There were other hurts: a therapist who was killed in a car accident; affairs with men who slipped away; the casual slights of sexist professors, including one who told her, when she asked a question in class, ""Yours was a voice out of the bedroom."" 
After ""An Unknown Woman"" was published, Ms. Koller contributed five essays to the Hers column in The New York Times, lyrical pieces about a life alone with her dogs and the pleasures of the natural world. In one, in which she delighted in the courtship of a pair of cardinals, she wrote, ""Do you still think I live alone in the country?"" 
In 1990, she published a second book, "" The Stations of Solitude,"" a manifesto for and primer to the solitary life . Writing in The Times, Judith Shulevitz found each of its chapters ""a beguiling rest stop on the road to self knowledge,"" but felt that its author ""lingers longer than she should on a rehash of the events that led up to her hermitic existence."" 
""She was a complicated woman,"" her niece Ms. Koller-Fox said. "" The idea that the solitary life brought one happiness didn't really hold true in her life ."" 
It is a paradox that her life provided inspiration for so many, even as she continued to struggle. In 1991, Bantam republished ""An Unknown Woman,"" and it's now a sought-after title on Amazon. 
""The default situation for most writers is that they're going to be forgotten,"" said Brad Bigelow, editor of the Neglected Books Page, a website devoted to out- of-print authors . In 2015, Mr. Bigelow exhumed ""An Unknown Woman,"" likening Ms. Koller, as many have, to Henry David Thoreau. 
""It takes deliberate acts of remembering to keep them from being lost,"" he wrote. ""Her book deserves to be read and studied as much as anything by Virginia Woolf.""",8/31/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,neither,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,2,0
176,"The College Student's Guide to Back-to-School Quarantine: Pop-Tarts, Cross-Stitch, Prison Morse Code; Some campuses are starting the year with a two-week lockdown to try to contain Covid-19, and that's a lot of alone time; 'I'm trying to fill up space.'","For 14 days, Nick Cipriani sat in a room at the Holiday Inn in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He ate salad, napped on one of the two queen-size beds, updated his résumé and began to knit a scarf. Occasionally, he'd look out the window and see families playing at the pool. 
Lockdown necessity 
Mr. Cipriani, a Skidmore College sophomore from Cincinnati, was one of around 225 students put up by the school at hotels for required two -week quarantines before moving to campus to start the fall semester. Students received welcome packs including snacks, instructions on when to put out dirty towels and garbage and a stapled packet of coloring pages featuring past exhibitions from the school's art museum. 
A highlight of Mr. Cipriani's quarantine was a virtual cross-stitching class; Skidmore provided materials and gave instructions over Zoom. They offered two pandemic-themed patterns: messages reading ""Wash Your Hands"" and ""Wear A Mask."" 
It's an odd start to fall semester at colleges across the country struggling with how to function during the pandemic . Lots of schools have decided to skip in-person classes completely. For those reopening campus , isolation and quarantine have replaced the welcome parties and packed social schedules that usually kick off the school year.
Thousands of college students have been forced to stay in solitary lockdown upon arrival, due to tight travel restrictions enacted by states including New York and Vermont. If it meant they would get a shot at actually going to college , taking classes in person and eventually seeing friends—even with masks on— they have been willing to put up with two weeks of questionable food, boredom and loneliness. 
The hope is that if students go through the quarantine , and then continue to wear masks, wash their hands and avoid large groups once they are allowed out of their rooms, the schools won't have to revert to online instruction like they did in the spring. Some colleges where students didn't quarantine on arrival and where off- campus gatherings have been documented have reported sharp spikes in Covid - 19 case counts, leading to campus closures . 
Sean Nesmith, a New York University junior from Marietta, Ga., has been bingeing episodes of ""Big Brother"" and FaceTiming with friends and family while staying alone in his on- campus apartment since Aug. 18. He and a neighbor sometimes tap on the wall to see if they can hear each other, prisoner-style. 
""That's the extent of our fun,"" Mr. Nesmith says. 
Decidedly less fun: mealtime. NYU students have posted widely on social media to complain about unappetizing meat and meals that don't meet kosher or vegan restrictions. 
Breakfast didn't arrive until well after noon some days, Mr. Nesmith says, a challenge when he wakes up by 9 a .m. ""Luckily I brought my applesauce and my Pop -Tarts in my suitcase, as personal necessities,"" he says. 
An NYU spokesman says the school's effort to deliver meals to nearly 2,700 quarantining students at 20 residence halls was ""an unprecedentedly complex undertaking,"" and they ""fell short of the plans we had in place."" NYU and its food service vendor, Chartwells, have since doubled food-prep staff and taken other measures to improve meal service, he says. 
Partway through quarantine , which ends Tuesday, NYU authorized residence hall staff to cover costs for outside food delivery when meals were inadequate. 
Nadieda Dazile, another NYU junior, says she has been doing virtual information sessions for jobs, practicing coding and participating in a school-sponsored trivia event. She is documenting some of her experiences on YouTube, including filming herself putting on makeup and working out. 
""I'm trying to fill up space ,"" she says. ""But there's a time in the day when it slows down, you're just laying on your bed scrolling through TikTok feeling like there's nothing else to do."" 
Brian Casey is spending two weeks in a roughly 12-by-15-foot Colgate University dorm room with no air conditioning. His biggest indulgence is walking down the hall each evening to get a caffeine-free Diet Coke from the soda machine. 
He's been busy. A masked assistant comes by the window once a day to hand off packets of papers he needs to sign—because Dr. Casey is Colgate's president, and he offered to quarantine in solidarity with his students . He gave his welcome address to families on move-in day from the room, his neatly made twin bed in the background. He wore a button-down shirt, blazer, gym shorts and no shoes.
The dorm doesn't really settle down until midnight, past Dr. Casey's normal bedtime. He hears explosions from neighbors' videogames, and the female occupants of a room upstairs are ""deeply committed to Taylor Swift,"" he says. 
For two, two-hour periods each day, Dr. Casey and his dorm-mates can go outside to a designated portion of the quad—which under state rules is akin to a home's backyard—for fresh air or a game of Frisbee, masked and socially distanced. 
When Grace Jin arrived at Yale University, she was required to stay in her suite, which has a few bedrooms and common area, until receiving a negative Covid - 19 test result, which the school said would take 24-36 hours. Then she would need to stay inside her residential college for the rest of the 14-day stretch, her movements confined to the residence, dining hall, courtyard and a few other dorm areas. 
The Yale senior, from North Carolina, arrived with three bags of belongings and two days worth of food, chosen from a menu of eight options. 
""It just felt very much like a ghost town,"" Ms. Jin says. The courtyard, normally filled with chatting groups and yard games, was nearly deserted. 
She and her suitemate talked and laughed late into the night as they waited for their test results. 
""I haven't really spoken to anyone my own age in person for so long,"" says Ms. Jin, who has been home with her parents all summer. ""We both just sat on the floor and were giddier than usual."" 
Nearly 93% of on- campus students at Yale this fall must quarantine upon arrival, the school says, due largely to Connecticut travel guidelines. 
Ms. Jin got her test results back after about 20 hours but waited until her suitemate got hers back later that day. They sprinted out of their dorm and into the courtyard at around 10 p.m. yelling, ""We're free!""

178,Blissful solitude by boat,"Feisty in springtime, the Missisquoi River, which flows from Quebec to the foothills of northern Vermont, was slow and summer-lazy in mid-August, when I launched a kayak a few miles south of the Canadian border. Green summits rose up behind me, past the closed border, but the river led westward, descending through dairy land and patchwork forest toward Lake Champlain. 
For three days after leaving Richford, Vt., I had paddled the Missisquoi alone, camping each night by the edge of the river, lullabied by crickets and the resonant hoots of a barred owl. As I steered my small boat along, I didn't see a soul on the water. 
Which was fine by me. Sharing a small house with three adults has made my pandemic blessedly convivial; it has also meant six straight months when I was rarely by myself. A camping trip by kayak was a quest for solitude in the waning summer. 
In choosing a boat trip, though, I was far from alone. Since spring, my Instagram had filled with images of my friends' shiny new canoes and kayaks. There's a logic to it: A watercraft is a way to get outside while staying away from others. Boats offer natural social distancing, often with a stiff breeze to boot. To see if the trend extended beyond my own circle, I called Steve Brownlee, the owner of Umiak Outdoor Outfitters, a Stowe, Vt., shop that caters to paddlers. 
""We sold a year's worth of boats in a single week,"" he told me, sounding incredulous. Interest outpaced anything he had seen in 45 years in the business. ""It's the biggest canoe resurgence since the movie 'Deliverance' came out,"" he said. (While film buffs recall the 1972 white-water thriller for violence and a dueling banjo, paddle-sports lore enshrines it as the inspiration for a generation of river enthusiasts.)
It's not just Vermont. U.S. sales of all paddle-sports equipment, including kayaks, canoes, rafts and paddleboards, were up 56 percent in June from the same time in 2019, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. The number of people getting out in canoes and kayaks increased more than 30 percent in April to June over the previous year. The Outdoor Industry Association, which tracks those participation rates, noted first-time participants account for two-thirds of the surge. 
Demand is so high that many buyers face weeks-long back orders. ""It's nothing we've ever experienced before,"" said Bill Kueper, the vice president of Wenonah Canoe, a Minnesota manufacturer known for its ultralight boats . ""Consumer demand for paddle sports went off the charts, and as an industry we're falling short. We don't have the capacity."" The company is hiring, and Kueper is taking regular shifts on the factory floor. 
The objects of this boat-buying frenzy range from molded plastic versions at big-box stores to Wenonah's high-end craft, with a price spectrum to match. Kueper told me scarcity is spurring consumers to try nearly anything. For my own trip, I packed a tent and sleeping bag into the 13-foot wooden sea kayak I built years ago in my parents' garage, reasoning that in a pandemic, the best boat for the job is one you already have. 
And amid travel restrictions and quarantines, the best river is a local river. Venturing just over an hour from my house in Richmond, Vt., I chose a 35-mile section of the 740-mile Northern Forest Canoe Trail, the longest freshwater paddling route in the Northeast. 
Splicing together rivers, streams, lakes and ponds across a dozen watersheds, the trail links Old Forge, N.Y., and Fort Kent, Maine. ""Through-paddling"" the route beginning to end might take anywhere from four to seven weeks, a feat of endurance only 119 paddlers have accomplished, according to the Northern Forest Canoe Trail's official roster. 
My goals were less ambitious, happily, because weeks of dry weather had reduced the current to a mere suggestion. Rapids dwindled to rippling cowlicks. The first day, a belted kingfisher slowed to pace me, flashing a bold white collar each time he swooped, impatient, between trees. 
Kingfishers and gray herons offered constant company along the Missisquoi, which is a haven for birds of all kinds. As I lunched on crackers and Vermont cheddar, bald eagles scouted clear eddies for trout. Calling out in chirping whistles, osprey fussed over treetop nests. Despite the wild feel, though, I often saw feathery tips of ripening corn waving over the riverbank, a reminder that people were rarely far away. 
Their lives, though, had turned away from the water. Like other communities in the Northeast, many Vermont river towns grew around textile and lumber mills, which eked livelihoods from rushing currents. One by one, the mills shut down. Left out of the working landscape, waterways became a back door to small towns, and a boat traveler may glide, unnoticed, through village centers built for another era. 
""The Northern Forest Canoe Trail runs through some pretty remote parts of the world,"" said Karrie Thomas, the trail's executive director. An expedition kayaker who has led trips in Nepal and Peru, Thomas said the NFCT stands out not for the remoteness it offers, but for the juxtaposition of wild and settled places. ""The trail also links together communities, instead of just taking you deep and far,"" she said. 
While my local river section is more bucolic than backwoods, town felt distant as night fell over the campsites where I slept. Each of the two free, no-reservation sites I stayed in - named Doe and Lussier for families that opened their land to the NFCT - had a rustic privy and a fire ring arched over by trees. At sunrise in Lussier campsite, I sipped coffee and watched a pair of red foxes emerge from a tangle of green on the opposite bank. 
From Lussier, I had 12 river miles to the Highgate Center dam, where I had left a car; I paddled hard to outpace a slate-bellied bank of rain clouds at my back. Another seven miles would have taken me to Swanton, a town near the historical location of a Western Abenaki village called Mazipskoik, a word later corrupted to Missisquoi. 
The people who lived there were paddlers: Many visitors to the Northern Forest Canoe Trail pilot craft that might have seemed familiar to the inhabitants of Mazipskoik. Archaeologists have found the remains of white pine dugouts by fishing ponds in Western Abenaki lands, while lightweight birchbark canoes served for long-distance river travel. Centuries ago, the canoe was already ancient. 
Radiocarbon dating of the oldest North American canoe remains suggests that they're 5,000 to 10,000 years old, said Mark Neuzil, a co-author of ""Canoes: A Natural History in North America."" A time traveler from that period could probably pick up a paddle, climb into a modern-day canoe and stroke away. ""Someone from 5,000 years ago . . . would know exactly what it was,"" Neuzil said.

But it wasn't until after the Civil War, Neuzil said, that the canoe became primarily a tool for recreation. At that time, Americans were traveling to lakes and rivers - including many in Vermont - to escape from increasingly crowded and industrial cities. As the pandemic summer of 2020 turns to autumn, I can relate.

179,"Readers Share Worry, Hope for Isolated Elderly in Covid Pandemic; A WSJ article about the negative health effects of isolation prompted readers to share their own experiences","Isolation in the pandemic is hitting elderly people especially hard, wrote Betsy Morris in a recent Wall Street Journal article . Many nursing homes and retirement communities instituted restrictions on visits and socializing in an effort to protect their vulnerable residents from the coronavirus, but loneliness and perceived isolation have also been linked to poor health outcomes. 
Many readers wrote in to share their own experiences with these challenges. Below is a selection of reader responses, which have been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
My 91-year-old mother, a lifelong amateur artist, lives in a large retirement community that imposed strict Covid -19 lockdown measures. She is a very social person, and I worried that the isolation and loneliness of the lockdown would have a negative impact on her health and, in particular, her mental well-being. So I wanted to figure out a way to help not only her but other seniors in her network to deal with the situation. 
Over the course of 10 weeks in April, May and the first half of June, I curated what I call ""Artmails"" and emailed them to my mother on a daily basis. In each Artmail, I profiled a modern or contemporary artist, included some bio and my own brief commentary and embedded a number of YouTube videos of the artist's work. All told, I created 50 Artmails: one a day each weekday for 10 consecutive weeks, usually late at night after my day job. (Each one took me about three hours to make, but they typically take about 30 to 35 minutes to read and watch.) 
My mother then shared them with a few of her senior-citizen friends. They were extremely popular among a handful of residents, and the positive feedback I received motivated me to keep going!

I am a geriatric physician in Los Angeles who makes house calls in assisted living and nursing homes. I have had over 60 cases and 30 deaths from Covid —but, at the same time, an equal number of deaths from general decline: poor appetite, falls, depression/suicidality. I have termed it ""PRLD"": Pandemic Related Lockdown Disease. It is much easier for agencies to pass guidelines and facilities to lock down than being creative in coming up with ways to interact, as well as the potential legal ramifications of a spread. 
Matthew Lefferman

I agree with everything you said. I am a medical director of nursing homes. But having said it, what is the solution? 
I thought we beat it by isolating to keep Covid -19 out of the homes. We did well for a while. Then came warmer weather and reopening. Insidiously, 19 out of 21 staff who tested positive were asymptomatic. Despite every good intention and practice, I now have 31 residents positive and four deaths so far. I am heartbroken. 
So we throw it open? It might work with the Covid -19 survivors. There will be more cases and more deaths among the non-infected. It is difficult to isolate everyone as we have wanderers, so contact tracing is elusive. Would families unanimously court the risk to end the isolation ? We continue to pray for an effective vaccine that could be the solution.

Everyone who has a loved one in a nursing home, sadly, is enduring a truly awful separation. Truly awful. I will say this, though: My 91-year-old mother has always been a letter writer, and now more than ever, her skills have been put to the test. So, for me, writing the weekly letter to her has become a part of the new routine. As I remind her, she is on the ""front lines"" dodging the ""bullet,"" and we, in relative safety, to boost her morale, will keep writing!",9/7/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6
185,Has forced isolation killed your social skills?,"It has recently come to management's attention that as a species, we have forgotten how to socialize. This is because we have been in our homes for half the year, having meaningful conversations with the following: children, house plants, whole grain cereals. 
Now that people may be (slowly, carefully, mask-edly) reintegrating into life, what is there to talk about? We have become sedentary lumps with few interests outside ""Selling Sunset"" on Netflix. Here's a sample conversation: 
""How's it going?"" 
""Oh, you know. Happy to have my health!"" 
""What have you been up to?"" 
pregnant pause 
""The grocery guy brought 2% instead of skim. You know, it's just, when am I going to catch a break?"" 
One option is to discuss the political, socioeconomic and public health state of the world. But with friends, one does not want to feel as if one is standing in a tire fire. 
To get our dazzling personalities back, we must start at the foundation of all human interaction: self-help books. I ventured into the public library. Choices, choices. ""Finding Your Way in a New World."" ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."" ""My Dad and Me"" by Larry King. 
Tempting, but there's no time for Larry King! I settled on ""How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less"" by Nicholas Boothman. The tagline: ""Learn to read body language, synchronize behavior and make warm, meaningful connections. For all occasions, business, social and personal.""
Someone near me started playing a soccer match loudly on his laptop. I remembered that being in public can be annoying, humans are rude and maybe home is not so bad. Rather than face the problem head on, I inserted earbuds, glowered and appeared less likable than ever. 
Back to the book. The greeting is important, he writes. Open your attitude and body language. Be the first one to make eye contact. Perfect, since eyes are all we have left. 
Be first to smile. (Well, that's out.) Say hello and attach your name to it. (Got it.) Extend your hand too. (No.) Do a subtle forward tilt. (Are we 6 feet apart?) Then a whole passage on handshakes. To be fair, this book was printed in 2000, when everything felt possible. 
The Spotify station drowning out the soccer match played Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C Minor, which any proper Celine Dion fan knows is the basis for ""All By Myself."" It was a sign. 
I switched to the miniature edition of ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie, published in 1936. Much more relevant. 
""If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself."" 
Now we were onto something. The key to being likable is to talk less about yourself. Give full attention to your friend's boring grocery stories, not your own. 
The soccer guy left, so to celebrate I thumbed through ""What My Cat Has Taught Me About Life"" by Niki Anderson. Some food was smudged inside the book, a faint reminder of our shared human experience. 
In one story, a cat named Maggie was having her semiannual molt. Poor Mags! Ah, but wait. Shedding is normal and makes way for new hair. 
Maybe this forced isolation has a positive side. Maybe we should study how we relate to one another -- good, bad or library soccer match -- before jumping back in to yammering about our latest drama. 
""Think positively about change,"" the cat book said. ""Regard it instead as an EXchange -- the surrender of one thing to gain another."" It ended with a quote by Thoreau: 
""Things do not change, we do.""

186,Eating disorder calls surge nearly 80% in isolation,"Eating disorders thrive in isolation . Which explains why health experts have seen a surge in people seeking help amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
The National Eating Disorders Association has reported steep increases, up to 78% during some months, in the number of calls and online chats compared to a year ago as millions of Americans quarantine to slow the spread of the virus.. 
""The pandemic has created an elevated sense of anxiety for everyone. For people with eating disorders , it is even more pronounced,"" NEDA's CEO Claire Mysko told USA TODAY. 
Eating disorders are serious but treatable mental illnesses that affect a person's eating behaviors – regardless of age, sex, gender, race, ethnicity and/or socioeconomic status.
They're also connected with other mental health diagnoses such as anxiety, depression, trauma and substance abuse. The recovery process can take months and typically involves relearning normal eating habits, coping skills and, most importantly, building a support system. 
Psychologists often recommend people with eating disorders ""to connect and to build community, and the important public health recommendations around physical distancing are actually in contrast to what people learn in recovery,"" Mysko said. 
""Connection is key because eating disorders really do thrive in isolation ,"" she said. 
The pandemic has also affected people who were not previously diagnosed with an eating disorder but were negatively impacted by their thoughts on food, weight, fitness and dieting, Mysko said. 
In Los Angeles, the group practice Eating Disorder Therapy LA has also had an increase in patients. The practice's director, Lauren Muhlheim, told USA TODAY they've been getting a lot of referrals from the outpatient treatment program at the University of California San Francisco. 
""We definitely saw a lot of people who really started exercising excessively and that seemed to exacerbate and trigger eating disorders in a certain portion of people,"" Muhlhein said. 
The ""cultural messaging"" on social media during the pandemic has also affected members of the eating disorders community, Mysko said. 
""COVID 19"" and ""Quarantine 15"" are both plays on ""freshman 15,"" referring to the 15 pounds that students gain during their first year of college. 
While some health experts fear that weight gain during the pandemic can lead to health risks like obesity, Mysko said there are many influencers and companies capitalizing on that message. 
People with eating disorders ""are feeling not only the negative impact of being isolated but also this pressure around, 'How do I have the ""perfect body"" in quarantine?' and it's having a really negative impact in our community,"" Mysko said. 
Muhlheim agreed. 
""Eating during a pandemic is normal and gaining weight during a pandemic is fine, too,"" said Muhlheim, author of ""When Your Teen Has an Eating Disorder: Practical Strategies to Help Your Teen Recover from Anorexia, Bulimia, and Binge Eating ."" 
""Having survived a pandemic is a success,"" she said. 
Here are some tips and resources: 
If you think that you or someone you know have warning signs of an eating disorder, get screened. Virtually connect with a community, such as a Helpline or support groups. 
Reach out to your support system and schedule a FaceTime or video chat during meal times.
Be thoughtful about your social media consumption and unfollow accounts that make you feel anxious. Instead, follow accounts that focus on self-care.",9/14/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3
187,"Loves boyfriend, but also loves solitude","DEAR CAROLYN: I love living alone. I had roommates all four years of college and after I graduated, I shared a house with other women. While I never had a really bad roommate, I've just never liked having someone else sharing my space. I've lived alone for the last five years and it has been wonderful. With roommates, I hated having to talk any time I saw them, having to ask for permission before having people over, having my stuff moved around, etc. I adore coming home, having it be absolutely quiet and just the way I left it, doing as I please on my weekends, and so on. I've been dating my boyfriend for a year and I love him very much and love his company for the most part. Lately, he's been asking if I'm interested in moving in together. But I just don't know. I love being with him. But after a long day at work I just want the option of coming home and not talking to anyone, making whatever I want to eat and not worrying about anyone else. I don't even feel like I sleep as well when I share a bed with my boyfriend ; I prefer having sex and then coming home to my own apartment to sleep. Something about being alone truly relaxes me. I worry about this since I do want to be married and have a family, so I'll eventually have to live with another person. Is this something I need therapy for, or will I get over feeling this way someday? 
Loner 
LONER: Would you please just show him this? It's so well said. 
RE: LONER: I feel the same way about solitude . Carolyn, could you offer a little more guidance on how to 'splain to a beloved significant other that as much as I love being together, I love /crave/need/bask in long hours of solitude as well? We are planning on sharing our lives in the same place, but I worry I won't find a good compromise in alone versus together time. How can it be done? 
In Solidarity
IN SOLIDARITY: Loner's explanation was clear, concise, compassionate, perfect. 
So I suspect what you're looking for is a bigger answer on whether this is OK, whether anyone will accept you this way, whether you have a right to ask? 
If so, my answer is, you are who you are, you are fine, you are worthy of love . You may or may not find the person who fits right into your ways, but we all live with that risk, because none of us is guaranteed a fit. All we are guaranteed is the power to be who we are and decide whom we let in. 
People find their compromises in all kinds of places, with accommodations as small as understandings and as big as separate homes. The important thing is that you say out loud who you are, how you feel and what you need, and hold out for a partner who is willing to hear these things without freaking out. 
As for whether someone can ""get over feeling this way,"" I think the better question is, can you get conflicting needs met -  solitude and family. I'd say yes, imperfectly, with self-knowledge and the right mate

188,ASMR videos helping people cope with isolation,"Between the constant flurry of news about the coronavirus pandemic and the feeling of isolation brought on by shutdowns and social distancing, the 21-year-old University of Maryland journalism student finds it difficult to quiet her mind and sleep. 
But Morris has a secret weapon against her quarantine-related insomnia: ASMR. 
ASMR, which stands for autonomous sensory meridian response, is often described as a tingling that starts in the head and moves down the spine. Not everyone feels this sensation, but those who do say it helps relieve stress and induce sleep.
There are thousands of ASMR videos on YouTube and they vary widely in subject. Examples include close ups of people eating crunchy foods, whispering, crinkling paper, tapping on glass and brushing hair. Though they started as a fringe trend around 2009, the phenomenon has grown in popularity with one of the most popular videos (a three-hour compilation of ASMR sound triggers) hitting more than 84 million views and celebrities like Cardi B, Aubrey Plaza and Zoe Kravitz filming their own versions. 
Now, ASMR is helping people like Morris cope with the pandemic with coronavirus-specific editions. Before the COVID-19 era, Morris says she would tune into these videos about once a week. Now, she watches them nightly. 
""It's difficult to turn off the news feed in your mind,"" Morris said. ""ASMR is this sort of very quiet, almost childlike space that I can go to, and it's totally separate from what's happening in the world."" 
People who make ASMR videos are called ASMRtists. One of those people is Lauren, who goes by Frivvi online and withholds her last name for privacy reasons. 
Her YouTube channel's popularity has spiked during the pandemic. FrivolousFox ASMR saw a 40% increase in monthly new subscribers from February to March when much of the country went into lockdown, she said. The trend has held up, with double-digit increases in the next two months. 
""Tons of people are coming in and saying 'Hey, this has been really rough for me the past few months, and you are my one human connection that I can count on,'"" Lauren said. 
Another ASMRtist, known as Taylor Darling, has also seen her audience grow. Before quarantine, Taylor says her ASMR livestreams would average 900 viewers on Twitch, a streaming platform popular among gamers. Now, they get 1,200. 
""Some people feel more lonely, more depressed, more anxious, and ASMR is meant to help relieve all of those feelings,"" said Taylor, who also withholds her last name. 
Though ASMR has been discussed online for years, scientific research is limited. Giulia Poerio, a psychology lecturer at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom, conducted a study published in 2018 that found people who say they feel ASMR demonstrated decreased heart rates and increased skin conductance levels – that is, the amount of sweat on their skin – when exposed to ASMR videos . 
""It's both euphoric and relaxing at the same time,"" Poerio said of the phenomenon. 
Emma Gray, a clinical psychologist and ASMRtist based in the United Kingdom, believes ASMR can offer short-term mental health benefits. 
""It seems that people have sought refuge from their mental health problems in the ASMR community for some time, but particularly during this difficult time,"" she said via email. ""The videos have become a very accessible way of dealing with the emotional challenges the pandemic has thrown up."" 
To help people cope with the pandemic, Lauren and Taylor have each made ASMR videos specifically for a socially distanced audience. In one of Lauren's videos , titled ""ASMR for COVID-19 Anxiety,"" she whispers to the viewer that they are not alone and that their feelings are valid.
""If we just stop, breathe and be smart do simple things, we can greatly increase our chances to get through this unscathed,"" she says while using her hands to rub a muffed microphone to create white noise in the background. 
In Taylor's coronavirus-themed ASMR video , she plays a soft-spoken doctor testing the viewer for COVID 19. Donning a white lab coat and face mask, Taylor pretends to take blood pressure and swab the back of the viewer's throat and nose. The video chatter tells viewers the role play is ""meant for relaxation and to raise awareness."" 
Taylor also says she's made it a point to whisper more positive sentiments in her videos , telling fans that ""everything's going to be OK"" and ""everything's fine."" 
According to Morris, ASMR videos don't just help people fall asleep – they also make people feel less alone. 
For Kevin Frazelis, a high school teacher in New York, ASMR was crucial at the beginning of quarantine in March. According to Frazelis, who lives alone, ASMR served as ""an antidote to the loneliness,"" making him feel like ""there was somebody else that could soothe me or make me feel a little bit better."" 
The ability of ASMR to make people feel less alone in quarantine, Lauren says, means these videos can benefit anyone, whether or not they feel tingles. 
""I have been quarantining since the end of January, and ASMR has been one of those things that, when I can't go see family or I can't see friends, I can put on a video and get that human connection and calm down and remind myself that we're not alone,"" she said. ""It's gonna be OK. We can push through this. And it gives you more hope.""",9/16/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,1
190,Voting in a Time of Isolation and Division: [Style Desk],"The national bard of community long warned about what isolation would do to us. Now our democracy is in the midst of an experiment no one asked for. 
From his back deck in southwestern New Hampshire, Robert D. Putnam sees his yard slope past a few hardwood trees and an overturned canoe down to a pond, beyond which looms Mount Monadnock, one of Henry David Thoreau's favorite peaks to hike. 
What he does not see, here or anywhere else, are many other people. 
""We see, on average, one human being every week up here,"" said Mr. Putnam, referring to himself and his wife, Rosemary. 
There is poetic injustice in Mr. Putnam's forced solitude, for he is something like the national bard of community. In 2000, he published ""Bowling Alone,"" which documented Americans' dwindling social engagement (including their declining participation in bowling leagues), and for decades the Harvard University professor has studied the costs of isolation : the loneliness, the diminished trust, the dissolution of ""social capital"" -- those people-to-people connections that grease the wheels of civic life. 
Six months into the coronavirus, most Americans are in the same boat as Mr. Putnam, 79, their entire worlds shrunk into neighborhoods, households, computer screens. Yet they are also preparing to undertake that most communal of obligations, a national election, during an extraordinarily polarizing presidency that has only grown more so during a pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 Americans and a widespread movement protesting police violence and systemic racism.
As there is no precedent for this state of affairs, Mr. Putnam, whose forthcoming book, ""The Upswing,"" traces American individualism and its opposite, could only pose the all-important question. ""If you're lonely and feel isolated,"" he said, ""does that make you more likely not to engage with politics at all?"" 
While the logistical act of voting has been bent in the form of increased vote-by-mail, it is unknown how campaigns will execute their sprints to the finish line without large rallies and other typical tactics. 
More profoundly, it is not clear how social distancing will affect voters' choices. Before the coronavirus, according to Mr. Putnam, even the most prolific online networker, with his four-hour- a -day Facebook habit, still likely had one foot in the physical world, where he discovered and tended to his relationships. 
""Studies confirm that people tend to interact with the same individuals both offline and online,"" write Mr. Putnam and Jonah Hahn in a new ""Bowling Alone"" afterword. ""Few Americans have an offline life and an entirely separate online life."" 
Conversations with nearly a dozen thinkers from the worlds of political science, political psychology, technology, organizing and campaigning suggest that we are ill-designed for the pandemic election. The internet, many said, is centrifugal, driving people away from each other and toward only close friends, immediate family and themselves -- the opposite of the centripetal force that elections and their aftermaths demand, and that physical interactions often provide. 
Yet these thinkers have not abandoned all hope. Like the pandemic itself, the next several weeks, they said, will constitute an acid test for a frightened and divided country. 
""The virus turns on this,"" said Mr. Putnam. ""Are we a we, or are we an I?"" 
Decades of political science research instruct that whether and how the people closest to you vote plays a huge role in your own decisions. 
""Anyone who survived junior high knows social pressure is real,"" said Betsy Sinclair, a professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis. 
Spouses, parents and close friends -- those with whom one enjoys ""strong ties,"" in the jargon -- exert the most powerful pull on voters' behavior. Ms. Sinclair pointed to a study based around the 2010 midterm elections that found most of a person's Facebook friends had no impact on his voting behavior. Only his closest 10 friends, out of 150, did. In fact, he was only likely to be influenced by someone who had tagged him in a photo. 
But the ""weak ties"" that connect people to co-workers, neighbors and friends of friends are like the vermouth in the Martini of social discourse. Because your closest friends and family probably have similar politics as you, more casual acquaintances are likelier to upend your assumptions. If people's strong ties polarize them further, their weak ties undo some of that. Sever weak ties, as the pandemic partially has, and what is left is something more distilled and severe. 
""If you're a Democrat, you're probably not going to talk to a lot of Republicans in your family or among your friends -- there will probably be a lot of agreeing,"" said Samara M. Klar, a professor at the University of Arizona School of Government and Public Policy.
""But you are often subject to crosscutting pressures, as we call it, by surprise,"" she continued. ""You're at the grocery store, your kids' soccer games. These are important ways people are exposed to ideas with which they disagree."" 
These past few months, Ms. Klar has found herself going out of her way to talk to passers-by as she walks her hound and her terrier in her Tucson, Ariz., neighborhood. But she knows that for most Americans, happenstance physical encounters have been crimped. 
""I wish there were something good that could come of this pandemic, but I have not found anything,"" Ms. Klar said. 
In theory, the internet could step in and supply these spontaneous conversations. In practice, the internet does not always work that way, argued Mark Granovetter, a professor of sociology at Stanford University. 
""Are people online more? Probably,"" he said. ""Spending more time interacting? Probably. 
""Are they still consigned to echo chambers, or are they reaching out?"" he asked. The answer is not easy to know. 
For Mr. Putnam, the internet has been a salve. Rosemary Putnam stays in touch with her friends via Facebook and the Words with Friends game. In April, 25 members of the Putnam family gathered over Zoom for a Passover Seder. 
But Mr. Putnam believes the internet can supplement, not replace, connections initiated and tended to ""IRL -- in real life,"" as he put it. 
There has been one arguable exception in this summer of social distancing: thousands of protesters galvanized by the police killings of Black people took to the streets of many cities. 
Much of the protests' power lay in their occupation of physical space -- shutting down traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge, for example. This made them un-ignorable to observers they hoped to win to their side, said Aaron Schutz, a community studies professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. 
""There is something about the ability to get masses of people together to make a statement that just can't be done in the same way online,"" he said. 
By contrast, when Mr. Schutz volunteered last month as an American Civil Liberties Union legal observer of protests during the Democratic National Convention -- or what was left of the D.N.C., after the pandemic had reduced the Milwaukee gathering to a small, pro forma ritual totally eclipsed by the eight-hour infomercial produced for television -- ""there were tumbleweeds,"" he said. The pandemic had offed a once-promising opportunity for disruptive protest. 
Few have thought more about the implications of a life lived digitally than the thinker and author Jaron Lanier, who coined the term ""virtual reality."" These days, from his home in Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Lanier frets about quarantine's effect on discourse, even as he welcomes the proliferation of video chats, because they are things people plan online rather than passively accept.
As the homebound spend more time online, where algorithms prioritize giving us what we want, like so many hamster-food pellets, rather than responsibly reflecting reality, will the common ground necessary for meaningful debate persist? 
""If everyone thinks the same thing, the conversations aren't substantial, and if they think completely different things, they aren't, either,"" Mr. Lanier said. 
It is not just society that is built for person-to-person interactions, according to Mr. Lanier. People are, too. Humans subconsciously register interlocutors' eye direction, head pose and posture when they face each other in the flesh. Being unable to do it inhibits communication. 
Mr. Lanier helped develop the new ""Together mode"" of Microsoft Teams, the videoconferencing service. Its interface places all members of a video chat in a common audience. Participants see themselves seated among everyone else and they detect nonverbal cues, and, Mr. Lanier said, their primate brains' panic responses are not activated. 
""With everyone being really stressed out,"" he said, ""it feeds into the fear and aggression, the fight-or-flight driven style , that both the algorithms and propaganda gravitate towards."" 
Still, the show must go on. Despite the pandemic and the president's own stated wishes, the election will culminate on Nov. 3. 
David Kochel, a veteran Republican operative, said a client, Senator Joni Ernst, is going ahead with a traditional tour of all 99 Iowa counties as she seeks re-election in one of this fall's more competitive races. She is adding extra conference calls, tele-town halls, Zoom meetings. 
""Candidates who have a natural ability to communicate via social media probably benefit,"" he said. ""The lack of in -person campaigning probably makes financial resources more important, because more of the messaging work has to be done via paid media."" 
Jorge Gonzalez, an organizer at the Environmental Health Coalition, based in the San Diego area, is targeting low-propensity voters. But the coronavirus foreclosed what he knows is the most effective tactic, which is showing up at front doors and speaking face-to-face. 
Mr. Gonzalez is still sending canvassers to front doors. But they are leaving literature (in English, Spanish and Vietnamese) designed by local graphic artists. They are calling voters and, along with asking them to pledge to vote, offering periodic texts with logistical voting information. 
Mr. Gonzalez's initiative, United to Vote, is encouraging vote-by-mail. ""It's really about making it easy for folks who are just doing it for the first time ,"" he said. 
But will they choose to vote? Tasha S. Philpot, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, said that much depends on whether potential voters, living in a crisis, feel their votes can lead to change. 
""One of the things we talk about in public opinion is this sense of efficacy,"" Ms. Philpot said. ""The idea that you can make a difference fuels your willingness to try to make a difference.""
Of course, the same thing that can spur one to action can drain one's desire to act. Ms. Philpot has experienced this dichotomy in her own life. The killing of George Floyd in May, coming during a time she had largely spent isolated at home, ""wore on my psyche,"" she said. But her voice perked up when describing the Black Lives Matter video her 11-year-old daughter, Natalie, made over the summer. 
""A lot of Black politics is fueled by wanting to dismantle oppression, racism and discrimination,"" said Ms. Philpot, an editor of the book ""African-American Political Psychology."" ""It's almost as if that anger fuels activism."" 
Similarly, the volume of emails between Mr. Putnam and a friend of his has increased during the pandemic. The two have an agreement: If one determines a political candidate is worthy of a donation, the other will contribute as well. 
""There's reciprocity,"" Mr. Putnam said. ""But I'm not doing it face-to-face. I'm doing it through the medium of the internet."" 
Ms. Sinclair, of Washington University, was prompted by her interest in social contexts to develop an app, Magnify, that facilitates collective action around governmental issues. 
A Magnify user can post a civiccomplaint -- say, a photo of a pothole -- and share it with her neighbors, who can publicly agree on the app to write letters to their city councilperson. (Peer pressure strikes again.)

192,"2,000 Miles, 650 Trails, No One in Sight: The Solitude of Hiking in a Time of Virus","GORHAM, N.H. —It was well after dark on a recent evening when Philip Carcia, a record-breaking hiker, emerged from another 28-mile day in the woods, his legs streaked with mud and crisscrossed with bloody cuts, into a 
desolate parking lot near New Hampshire’s border with Maine. 
Carcia, 36, has been living out of his red Toyota Yaris on the outer reaches of the White Mountain National Forest all summer, attempting to break the record on an obscure and extreme hiking challenge known as the Redline: a journey through all 650 trails in a guidebook of the White Mountains, for a total of 2,000 miles and half a million feet of vertical gain. 
The trip almost didn’t happen. Like so much else canceled amid the coronavirus pandemic, serious hiking has been in doubt. In the early months of the outbreak, venerable organizations like the Appalachian Mountain Club closed their mountaintop huts, and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy emailed hikers attempting the trek from Georgia to Maine in March and asked them to stay home. 
Carcia watched some of his hiking friends get off the trail. He thought about canceling his trip, but then decided to press on. The intentional isolation of hiking might hold some answers for the forced isolation of the virus. “As I watched people around me slip into this sense of hopelessness, I realized it was actually a good time to do it —to get away from all that and look inward, stay focused, stay driven, remind myself of all the things in this world that are still good,” he said. 
By the end of this weekend,, Carcia is expected to finish the Redline after fewer than 100 days —a speed that will likely set a record, once all the details and GPS proof is vetted by the experts who serve as arbiters in the world of intensive hiking. In any case, Carcia hikes briskly. The previous record for the Redline was 193 days. Few groups may be as uniquely prepared for life in a pandemic as competitive hikers. Isolation (Carcia, who mainly slept in his car, went days without seeing anyone) and uncertainty about what’s ahead (some trails on his map seemed to disappear in real life) are nothing new. 
“I’m interested in all of it,” Carcia said of the solitary nature of hiking —and of life in this uncertain moment. “The human experience and all it encompasses —the good, the bad, the light, the dark.” 
Like others in Carcia’s circle of extreme hikers, he works all sorts of jobs to fund his hikes. He’s waited tables at a Ruby Tuesday in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he grew up, and has worked at a hostel in Woodstock, New Hampshire. 
The hikes are what drives him. Last year, Carcia took on a different challenge, known as the Grid. Every month, he hiked all 48 of New Hampshire’s mountains taller than 4,000 feet for a total of 576 summits. It took 319 days, and set a record. 
In the first months of the pandemic early this year, officials worried that serious distance hikers —particularly Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trail thru-hikers who spend weeks and even months out at a stretch —might travel in and out of small towns to sleep or get supplies and inadvertently spread the virus. Other fears emerged, too: Hikers might cross state lines without following quarantine rules, or get injured and strain medical resources that the virus was already stretching in small, rural communities. 
But state guidelines loosened over the summer, and some hiking organizations began encouraging people to proceed with hikes but to follow COVID-19 safety guidelines, including social distancing and masks. Some mountain huts were reopened for daytime use. Some trailheads and camping sites that had been shuttered were reopened, and trails grew crowded through the summer. 
The Appalachian Mountain Club’s stance on hiking during the pandemic, according to Nina Paus-Weiler, digital media and communications manager at the club, is, “This is a positive thing —you should go do this.” But, she added, “we are urging people to be prepared and follow state and federal safety guidelines.” Carcia wrestled with what to do. “When COVID hit, I like everybody else was forced to stop in my tracks and reconsider,” he said. He knew that he would be in the more remote sections of forest, far from tended paths, far from everyone. In the end, that sealed his decision. 
Years ago, when Carcia first began hiking, he said he wasn’t comfortable “with where my mind would go during long periods of solitude.” 
Over years of hikes —he’s walked the Appalachian Trail and Pacific Cresst Trail, each 2,000-odd miles —he learned to live with the discomfort that comes from venturing into places where he didn’t know what to expect. That’s why 
now, he said, “It’s no problem for me to be knee-deep in a river ford at 9 o’clock at night, and not able to see where the trail picks up on the other side.”  
He had some years of wandering and some setbacks. He bummed around the West, seriously injured himself in a fall on Mount Whitney. While doing a partial hike of the Continental Divide Trail in Wyoming, he was involved in a car crash and the next day was going home on a Greyhound, battered. 
The following year, in 2014, his father died of lung cancer. For weeks, Carcia slept on the floor of his father’s hospital room. “He’d made the gambit we all make, that we’ll work and make money and be able to enjoy it someday, but he didn’t,” he said. 
Loss sharpened his resolve. He moved to New Hampshire in 2015 and started training to break the record on the two biggest challenges in the White Mountains —the Grid and the Redline. “I wanted to do something really big,” he said. 
On a recent day, he paused on a ridge to stare down the trail into a valley where he would backtrack 5.9 miles to his car, a distance he could cover in an hour if he ran. Nearing the end of the Redline, he said he’s still sometimes plagued by the “mental digressions everyone goes through,” questions like, will he make it? And will it matter in the end? 
Hiking, Carcia said, “is hard, but not for the reasons people tell you it’s hard. It’s hard because these mountains are mirrors, just like COVID is a mirror, and they force you to look at yourself. But I love that. I love getting into that underbelly and still having the grit to keep moving forward.”",9/26/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3

195,"Dreams of being alone, but all together, at a bar","I don't remember the last time I went to a bar. I don't remember the last time I pulled out a barstool or leaned over a counter to order a beer. That's the nature of going to a bar, I guess -- fuzzy memories and all that. But it's also the nature of habit, of the things we get used to and that become easily forgotten.  
Before the COVID-19 shutdown, we had plenty of those things, and all it took was a worldwide pandemic to turn routine into longing. Which is all to say: After more than six months of staying away, I really miss going to the bar. In particular, I miss solo sessions at a well-worn wooden bartop, nursing a pull or two from the tap and feeling vaguely pensive while watching the bartenders work their magic. Or maybe a low-stakes sit-down with a dear friend -- the kind with whom conversation can be optional, and the tab will eventually work itself out. At the right bar, a strange kind of peace can be found in solitude among all the life happening there. Soaking in the communion of booze, the sound of strangers -- not coronavirus -- hanging in the air and reminding us that we're all here, now, together, even if you are physically alone. 
Earlier in the pandemic, following the death of John Prine, I was spending a lot of time with the bottle, which just so happens to be a great way to enjoy his music. In any case, during one particularly stirring playback of ""Yes I Guess They Oughta Name a Drink After You"" -- a honky bluegrass joint that was made for a bar jukebox -- I felt like texting a friend to share the song. ""This makes me want to pour a drink,"" I wrote. He countered, simply: ""This makes me want to go to a bar."" 
His reply felt like a revelation to my quarantine-addled mind. Such a simple distinction now feels more like a social rubicon that we hope to someday cross again. The distance between me and another guest situated one stool down the bar has never felt further. At this point, I wouldn't even mind if someone took the one right next to me, if that meant social distancing was over. 
Don't get me wrong; I know some bars are open (and taverns can open again in Chicago starting Thursday). But an outdoor patio is just not the same as a perch at the bar, let alone the kind of setting we used to know on a Saturday night out. Remember enjoying an exchange with a worker without being afraid for their health? Close talking with friends, without a mask, in the same old spot? Having somewhere else to go inside, and to escape? The company of a good bartender is a special comfort too: how they can measure your mood by a glance and a drink order. Anyone who has ever formed a bond with the person behind their favorite bar knows this. These people, literally, take care of us when we are out having good times, the moments for which we work 40 hours -- or more! -- every week to enjoy. During our ""time off,"" they are waiting to share it again and say hello. Sometimes, it can just be reassuring to claim a seat, to occupy some space and to have a person on the other side of the counter remind you that you still exist. 
That treatment goes for anyone working in hospitality. Whatever bars and restaurants look like in a post-pandemic future, I hope the labor and love of workers come to be appropriately cherished. 
Feeling at home in these places is cultural cliche, sure, but against the volatility of the last few months, the familiarity of a cliche doesn't sound so bad right now. 
Amid the slog of our onetime commutes and workdays, I would find peace settling into a barstool alone, counting my pints, maybe sipping a shot of something stronger, depending on how long I stayed. There is something reassuring about being alone in a crowd, in finding a bit of stillness for yourself among the 
friendly chaos of an uninterrupted jukebox, clinking glasses, barflies meditating alone and friends talking across tall tables, laughing too hard. 
To that end, it's also the people, really. I miss being around people, which is something I've learned about myself during quarantine. I'm tired of being alone, but all together, in a national pandemic -- I want to go back to being alone, but all together, in a bar. 
However, the doors to our favorite bars and taverns and restaurants and cafes are closing, more and more: Guthrie's Tavern, Income Tax, Jeri's Grill, not to mention every music venue in Chicago. It just makes me sad, and I do not believe I am alone in that. Among an exhausting barrage of tragedies, the shuttering of a business can sometimes feel paltry, but a profoundly upsetting social climate shouldn't take away from what we feel at the loss of a space that people love. 
Having a safe place to go, enjoying the company of strangers, the very nature of service at bars -- these things have always been a privilege, to be sure. Mourning the loss of this setting feels natural, though. Neighborhood haunts -- particularly the bars -- give us places of habit and humanity, of routine and respite. Those things all feel different now. 
Months into a global emergency, I've spent a lot more time trying to remember my last specific venture to a watering hole than I really would have expected. Frankly, I probably won't ever remember. But sitting alone in my apartment six months into a pandemic and reminiscing about the time I used to spend barside has made me grateful for all the strange ways it helped me feel connected to other people, and to feel like I existed among the world.",9/29/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,neither,3,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,only benefits,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,9,0
196,U.S. Army Saw Rise in Suicides as Covid-19 Pandemic Locked Down Nation; Military leaders say stress of isolation from co-workers and family contributed to increase in deaths,"WASHINGTON—Suicides among U.S. soldiers climbed since March as pandemic lockdowns began nationwide, raising questions within the Pentagon about how much isolation and other factors related to the coronavirus outbreak are driving the rise in deaths. 
As of Aug. 31, 144 active-duty Army soldiers had killed themselves this year, up from 88 in the same period of 2019, defense officials said. 
When Army reservists and national guardsmen are added, the figure jumps to 200, the officials said, compared with 166 for the same period last year. During the month of July alone, 35 Army active duty, reserve and national guardsmen died of suicide, officials said. 
The suicide rate among active-duty Army soldiers is currently 36 per 100,000, defense officials said, up from 25.9 per 100,000 last year. The suicide rate nationwide is 14.2 per 100,000 Americans, and 22.8 per 100,000 among men, according to April statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Leaders across the services said they believed isolation—not only day-to-day but from families suffering from and dying of Covid-19—created additional stresses on the force. In addition, they said service members' inability to travel was a contributing factor. 
""The challenge that I've seen here is that the stressors that we have this year are much different than the stresses we had last year,"" said Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the Air Force chief of staff, last month. ""We don't have a chance for our airmen to connect and be close to the folks that they work with on a day-to-day basis."" Suicide rates were roughly flat among Air Force and Navy personnel. 
As of Sept. 27, there were 98 suicides among active duty, reservists, national guard airmen and civilian employees, Gen. Brown told the Air Force Association that day. That figure was comparable to the same period last year, Air Force officials said, which marked a 33% increase over 2018. 
Overall, the Air Force has found that 45% of those who commit suicide are struggling with relationship issues, Gen. Brown said. 
In the Navy, 40 active duty and 10 reservists died by suicide through Aug. 31, which were comparable figures to the same period last year, defense officials said. In all, 72 sailors died by suicide in 2019, according to Pentagon statistics. 
The Marine Corps hasn't released its 2020 figures. According to 2019 Pentagon statistics, there were 47 suicides among active-duty members of the Marine Corps. 
The Pentagon is expected to release its third-quarter statistics within days. But at a briefing Thursday about suicides across the force, the Pentagon declined to address the rising 2020 figures, repeatedly calling them ""premature."" Instead, the officials would discuss only 2019 figures. 
""To make a conclusion at this point in time would be premature,"" said Dr. Karin Orvis, director of the Defense Suicide Prevention Office. ""We really need to make sure our data is accurate because we use our data to drive our 
policy and programming decisions."" 
In all, there were 344 suicides among active-duty troops in 2019 compared with 326 in 2018, according to Pentagon statistics.",10/1/20,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,2
199,"The isolation of Rita Thomas: “I don’t want to live this way anymore,” the 95-year-old told her daughter","TALLAHASSEE Rita Thomas was a victim of COVID-19, but she never had the disease. 
The vivacious and outgoing 95-year-old, who lived independently until last year and celebrated her most recent birthday in February with friends at a Pasco County diner, willed herself to die two weeks ago because she could no longer handle the pandemic-imposed isolation. 
She said to me: Linda. Ive had a good life. I am ready to die. I dont want to live this way anymore. I stopped eating, her daughter Linda Gardner said, recalling the conversation she had with her mother just a month ago. Three weeks later, her mother was hospitalized for complications from malnutrition. 
For the last 18 months Thomas lived at Rosecastle of Zephyrhills Assisted Living &Memory Care, an 85-bed long term care community. She filled her days with routine: dining out at restaurants, playing bingo and cards, going for daily walks and visiting every weekend with her daughter, family and friends. 
But on March 13, when Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Agency for Health Care Administration ordered that visits be banned from nursing homes and assisted living facilities in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19, all that daily activity stopped. Although the order allowed homes to make exceptions for certain family members to visit their relatives, most homes, including Rosecastle, resisted. 
At first, Thomas family accepted it. The coronavirus that was ravaging the globe preyed on seniors like Rita, who had recovered from a stroke and minor surgery but whose weakened immune system made her vulnerable to infection. 
Sometimes shed say somethings like: I just dont understand. Why are they doing this to us? recalled Nan Thomas, Rita Thomas younger daughter. We kept hoping they were going to open the doors and I would be able to bring her to my house again, and wed go out to eat, get her strong. 
Instead, as the rest of the state opened up, the lockdown and isolation continued at Floridas elder care homes. I truly hold the governor and his medical advisers responsible for my mothers quick decline and her pending death, Nan Thomas wrote to the Times/Herald, days after bringing her mother home to die rather than leaving her in a hospital. 
My mother didnt die from a heart attack, or a stroke, Thomas said this week. She didnt die from old age. My mother died from long-term isolation. That is what killed her. 
For his part, the governor has said a top priority is the safety and security of the states vulnerable elders. Early in the pandemic, his emergency officials directed personal protective equipment and coronavirus testing kits to facilities. But he has also drawn criticism from advocates for his inconsistent and incomplete testing policy at long-term care facilities, waiting more than three months to require regular testing of staff, despite evidence they were the primary source of infection. And, starting this month, his Agency for Health Care Administration will no longer require staffers at assisted living facilities like Rosecastle to be tested regularly for the contagious disease. Perils of isolation 
There is little data about the mental health effects of the extended lockdown at long-term care facilities in the United States, but medical experts have long known that prolonged isolation contributes to memory loss and other cognitive problems for older adults. 
For Rita Thomas, the lockdown led to confusion and paranoia. She was allowed to walk outside, but she would PDF GENERATED BY PROQUEST.COM Page 1 of 5
forget how to get back in. She lost a hearing aid (which after her death her daughters would find in a cabinet in her room). She told her daughters that it was hard to understand the staff, who were wearing masks. She no longer remembered how to turn on or off her TV. 
Instead of communal dining, the residents of Rosecastle were served three meals a day in their rooms. She lost so much weight in six months that she went from a size medium to an extra small. 
All we knew is, she was miserable, Nan Thomas said. She could no longer go to her window to open the blinds and, in the last few months, she was too confused to know how to answer the phone for me to tell her to go to her window. 
There is mounting evidence that Rita Thomas is not alone. 
This isolation is becoming just as much of a pandemic in the facilities as COVID has, said Brian Lee, director of Families for Better Care, an elder care advocacy group. But were not tracking it like we are COVID because thats easier to track than isolation, despair, depression and suicidal ideations. Thats why its important we get the families back in to see what is going on. 
Rita Thomas death certificate read failure to thrive, her daughters said. 
Dan Blazer, a Duke University professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, is one of the authors of a report released in February that found that seniors who face social isolation experience a higher risk of mortality, heart disease and depression. 
Rita Thomas case was extreme, but COVID exacerbates an issue that is already there for many older people, he said. 
One of the major public health problems in our country is social isolation and (long-term care) homes want to keep COVID out of these institutions, so they lock down the institution. But, over a long period of time that is not good for older persons. It affects their health and their well-being. 
Should I go? 
The staff at Rosecastle knew this, too. The homes activities director, Marcee Riddle, said she tried her best to keep things normal for Thomas and other residents. She organized parades, gathered small groups for exercises, held Tatoo Tuesdays with fake tatoos, and with the hair dresser not considered essential staff and no longer making appointments, Riddle tried to do her part to fill in. 
I put curlers in Ritas hair, she said Wednesday, choking up at remembering her friend. 
Riddle also was so determined not to infect any of the residents, she completely changed her own lifestyle. I have not gone to a retail store since March 13, she said. My husband gets my gas for me; he goes to the store. I literally go from home to work and back, not only to keep myself safe, but to keep the residents safe. But for Rita Thomas, even the extraordinary efforts of some caring staff were no substitute for the touch of her loved ones. She began to be afraid to be alone in her own room, the one place where she was having to spend all her time. 
She would walk the halls to escape her room, and at night would get agitated and anxious, so her daughters urged her to go to bed earlier each night. One night, she was so agitated Gardner had to sing her to sleep to calm her down. 
There were glimpses of the kind-hearted mother they knew, whom they expected to live to be 100, like her relatives. Sometimes she would leave handwritten notes about Riddle and other members of the staff whom she just loves and or simple kindnesses intended for Gardner and Thomas. 
In classic penmanship, with a shaky hand, one haunting note mentioned a relative, then said: Id give anything to see them at least once more, but not at this change. Trying to decide if should go. Love to you all. Many nice people around. 
Technology provided the sliver of regular contact they had. Gardner, who lives in Maine where her mother spent most of her life before moving to Florida in 1992, had set up an Echo Show device in her mothers room. She used it to speak with Thomas, who would often use it to call multiple times a day. 
The spark started to fade from my mothers eyes, Gardner said. There was no spirit left. 
By August, the phone calls became further and further apart. Shed always ask, When is this going to end? recalled. Cure worse than gamble 
But it didnt end and, as Gardner worked on coaxing her mother through each day, Nan Thomas started writing emails to the governor, state Sen. Tom Lee, R-Thonotosassa, and her state Rep. Larry Maggard, R-Dade City, urging him to modify the rule. 
The cure is now worse than the gamble, Thomas, who calls herself a conservative Republican, wrote June 17 to Maggard. Each day her voice gets weaker. When she does answer her phone, she cries and asks me why I wont visit her. I am losing my intelligent, spunky mother not to coronavirus, but to the virus of politics and apathy. The only meaningful response came in an email from the Agency for Health Care Administration, days after her mother died, when they told her of the new visitation rule. 
After pressure from families like the Thomases, the governors Task Force on the Safe and Limited Re-Opening of Long-Term Care Facilities convened in August to consider alternatives to the strict ban on family visitors. The governor signed a new order effective Sept. 1, allowing homes without a positive COVID case among staff or residents for two weeks to open the door to visitors under restrictions. But the rule is not mandatory, and the application of it remains uneven. 
Because a Rosecastle staff member tested positive on Sept. 1, the rule barred it from accepting visitors until Sept. 15, and by then it was too late. Rita Thomas died on a hospital bed in her daughters living room on Sept. 18. When everything was taken from her all normalcy, all routine and communication the one place she had some power was her power to live, Nan Thomas said. 
Gardner, who has a background in long-term care and advocacy, told her mother she would support her when she chose to stop eating. But it was a painful place to be. 
I didnt know how to help. I couldnt help her, she said. I couldnt even get on a plane. I mean, they didnt want us traveling. You know, I I just felt so useless. 
Visiting mandates needed 
Blazer, of Duke University, said there is a lesson here going forward. 
While the rest of the community opened up, they never really opened it up for the elderly, he said. The use of technology, such as tablets and phones, as a substitute are not ideal because many older people dont have the skills or the equipment, he said. He argues that, instead of looking for quick, easy solutions, regulators should require homes to develop protocols that allow them to have visitors on a regular basis for people who live in their homes. 
Across the nation, Florida is among 43 states that have ended their ban on visitors in long-term care facilities and now allow some form of in-person contact, according to AARP, but few require homes to offer it, leading to vast variations within a state. 
Steve Bahmer, CEO of LeadingAge, which represents 400 continuing care communities in Florida, said that all of their members are now allowing some visitors. 
In spite of our members constant efforts to use technology to keep residents connected to their families, theres just no replacing being there in person, he said. We know thats taken a toll in terms of loneliness and disconnection. 
Gardner and Thomas say they are grateful for the love and support of the Rosecastle staff, but are frustrated at what they consider a flawed and inconsistent policy. 
They describe how, after their mother died, they went to her apartment at Rosecastle four separate times to clean out her room, and only once were they asked to wear personal protective equipment. They wonder if a fear of lawsuits contributed to the lengthy ban on visitors. 
You cant sue anybody after that point, Gardner said. She was dead. They are protecting themselves. Chantel Aube, president of Rosecastle Management, which owns four facilities in Florida, didnt address the liability issue but said the organization has mirrored our policy and procedure based on the governors order. Its the inconsistency that has been frustrating, Thomas said. A delivery person can walk in my mothers hallway, 
but I cant. Its the same virus everywhere, but people are treated differently. It makes no sense.",10/5/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,9
202,"The Dream Is Real: You're Finally Home Alone Again; As family members head out of the house more for work or school, people who have gone months without quiet time are savoring some while they can","One morning in September, I crept down the stairs and was greeted with an unfamiliar sound: nothing at all. Our babysitter had just pulled out of the driveway, both kids in tow, en route to the playground. My husband was at work. I stood there in the kitchen, equal parts electrified and off-kilter. For the first time in months, I was home alone. 
Around the world, as people start to head back to the office and many kids shuffle off to in-person school at least part-time, those of us left behind are emerging from the corners we've been holed up in trying to get some privacy all these months. We're taking off our headphones, leaving doors ajar and trying to figure out how to seize the sudden, precious and possibly fleeting solitude. 
""When it starts to happen, it's just sort of the heavens-opening-up moment,"" says Laura Vanderkam, an author who's studied time diaries of working parents. ""It almost feels scandalous that you are getting this time in a quiet house by yourself."" 
You may have imagined some dramatic celebration or ceremonial rite to mark the occasion—say, dancing in your bathrobe in the living room—but it turns out freedom mostly looks like wandering the house in a delighted stupor, savoring the vestiges of pre-lockdown quotidian life. A dad of four in Indiana told me he was indulging in solo vacuuming breaks during the workday. A legal consultant in the London suburbs was reveling in his newfound ability to water the backyard without interruption. 
""We've all been together essentially every minute of every day since January,"" says Karen Grépin, a public health professor in Hong Kong who became round-the-clock tech support for her two sons during months of virtual classes and camps. On Sept. 23, after they boarded the school bus, she drank her coffee in silence. ""I was all alone,"" she says. ""It was very weird."" 
""I felt wonderful,"" she adds. 
The pleasures of solitude are often a luxury for people with a lucky set of circumstances. For many, the pandemic has been marked by profound loneliness . Those who live alone have faced deepened isolation. Others remain separated from loved ones by closed borders or must keep distance from at-risk relatives in the hopes it protects them from the virus. 
Still, those who have been holed up with family for months say they wouldn't mind a break from their roommates at this point. 
When Stephanie Matta's parents decided to depart for a daylong trip to Cape Cod with friends at the end of the summer, the 25-year-old declined to join them, adding, ""I love you guys, but please don't let anything cancel your plans."" 
Ms. Matta, who moved back into her childhood home in March when her graduate program in speech language 
pathology went online, had found herself pining for things like complete control over the thermostat or the ability to gab freely while on the phone with a friend. 
""I'm always wondering, can someone hear me right now?"" she says. 
For nine hours at the end of August, when the answer was a resounding no, Ms. Matta blasted music from the Broadway show ""Hamilton,"" singing at the top of her lungs. She claimed the comfiest spot on the couch. And she left her dishes in the sink for an hour. 
""It just felt freeing,"" she says. ""I can live however I want for the whole day."" 
Even 15 minutes of alone time can have a calming effect, says Thuy-vy T. Nguyen, an assistant professor at England's Durham University who studies solitude. Her research finds that time by ourselves leads to a drop in positive and negative emotional states of arousal, from the buzzy energy you feel at a concert to anger and anxiety. The result is generally relaxation, though sometimes boredom can creep in too. On our own, there are fewer stimuli and no social expectations. 
That might explain why Sarah O'Donnell, an auditor and mother of two in New Jersey, felt empowered to keep a whole Snickers to herself while she was home alone for the first time since March. 
""I finally realized I was free to go get my sneaky bar of chocolate, and I wasn't going to share it with anyone,"" she says. 
Over the previous months, her days had been a blur of parenting and work. 
""My only quiet time would be getting on the Peloton bike and having someone shout at me,"" she says. Now she curled up on her back deck, chocolate in hand, feeling no guilt. 
Reminders abound that these peaceful interludes could vanish at any time. In Israel , across Europe and in New York City , restrictions on businesses and movement are rolling out again. And even in places where schools remain open, plans feel precarious. 
Kelly-jayne Smith, a 48-year old single mother in the British coastal town of Clacton-on-Sea, spent a blissful recent evening in her empty house, eating her favorite Chinese takeout order and watching an entire movie without pausing once. Three days later, her youngest daughter landed home from her recently reopened school with a slight fever. 
Of the prospect of more alone time, Ms. Smith says: ""It doesn't look promising."" 
That's part of what froze me in place that recent morning—a disbelief that this could really hold, a bracing for the sudden return of noise and company. What if the kids forgot their snack cups? Was my husband planning to swing by the house for lunch? 
Then I remembered my own mother, who for my entire girlhood hosted an annual Champagne toast on the first day of school where neighborhood parents would celebrate their kids' departures. Carpe diem. I retrieved a cookie dough ball from my personal stash, hidden in the bowels of the freezer. I turned on Taylor Swift, and turned it louder. Before I knew it, I was dancing around the kitchen, joyfully and terribly. Oh well. No one was watching. 
You've Got the House to Yourself. Now What? 
* Have a plan: Many people don't deal with empty time well, Prof. Nguyen says. Have a goal and loose agenda for your solo stretch. That way you can look forward to it and avoid falling into worry and rumination when things are quiet. 
* Put down that phone: ""You can look at Instagram when the kids are tugging you to go get apple juice,"" Ms. Vanderkam says. Use this time to dive deeper into something that requires full concentration, like reading a book. * Set yourself up for success: Pick an activity you're interested and competent in, Prof. Nguyen says. Now isn't the time to try something super difficult—you don't want to come away feeling like a failure. * Establish boundaries: Tell those you live with you're taking some time alone and try to have them fully leave the house, if possible, for a set period. That way you're not constantly bracing for someone to walk in.",10/19/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,only benefits,3,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,7,1
209,Isolation's tragic toll on vets,"Regarding the Oct. 23 Politics &the Nation article ""Shutdown's grim toll on amputee vets"": For several years, I had the privilege of being a medical anthropologist at Walter Reed (both Army Medical Center and National Military Medical Center), conducting research with patients who had traumatically acquired limb loss. Our research showed that the patients in the physical rehabilitation program were able to achieve astonishing results in terms of their recovery from the consequences of their injuries. However, as we noted in publications and presentations, one worrisome trend was for former patients to have had limited social interactions and networks in the communities they returned to. These concerning signs of limited social networks can, if individuals feel isolated, contribute to negative psychological consequences.

210,A New 'Slow Killer' Overruns U.S. Nursing Homes: Isolation: [Foreign Desk],"KIRKLAND, Wash. -- After months of near-isolation inside his senior care facility, Charlie no longer recognizes his wife of almost 50 years. In another nursing home, Susan's toenails grew so long that she could not squeeze into her shoes. Ida lost 37 pounds and stopped speaking. Minnie cried and asked God to just take her. They are among thousands of older people stricken by another epidemic ravaging America's nursing homes -- an outbreak of loneliness, depression and atrophy fueled by the very lockdowns that were imposed to protect them from the coronavirus. 
""A slow killer,"" said Esther Sarachene, who said she watched her 82-year-old mother, Ida Pasik, wither and fall mute during the months she was confined to her nursing home room in Maryland. ""She didn't know who I was."" Covid-19 continues to scythe through the halls of long-term care facilities despite an array of safety measures and bans on visitors, put in place months ago to slow the devastation. 
More than 87,000 residents and workers have died of the virus, which has infected more than half a million people tied to facilities, and new clusters continue to erupt with numbing regularity: 16 people reported dead this month at a nursing home in Chesterfield, Va.; all 62 residents of a Kansas nursing home infected. At the same time, the damage of solitude is being overlooked, families and advocacy groups say. They say that widespread lockdowns are still necessary to protect people from the virus, but also that facilities must now confront a growing physical and mental toll of social isolation as the pandemic shows no sign of abating. Separation from family and friends is among the hardest deprivations of the pandemic. Experts say the absence can inflict particularly serious damage on people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, thousands of whom have been confined to their buildings since March. 
Operators of long-term care facilities say they are facing an impossible choice between depriving residents of vital human contact and inviting the virus inside. 
""We have to walk a very fine line,"" said Robin Dale, president of the Washington Health Care Association, a trade group that has noted a recent uptick in virus cases in the state's facilities amid a new surge nationally. ""We need to work toward more in-person visits, but it is difficult right now."" 
In more than two dozen interviews across the country, long-term care employees described increased confusion, anger and anxiety among residents. Family members said their relatives were deteriorating in short-staffed facilities that have pared back physical therapy, exercise classes and visits into the community. One worker described how a resident told her one evening that she was the first person she had seen all day. ""Mom's just not there,"" said Deanna Williams, as she and two siblings headed to the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., to visit their 89-year-old mother, Peggy Walsh, who loved motoring around the country before she developed dementia. 
Life Care, in suburban Seattle, was the nation's first Covid-19 hot spot in February, a place that gave a first glimpse at how the virus could tear through homes. Forty-six Life Care residents have died. 
Since the outbreak, as the deaths of residents of long-term care facilities swelled to account for almost 40 percent of the country's 229,600 coronavirus deaths, Ms. Walsh has spent each day sitting quietly in her wheelchair, facing the fence and bushes outside her room. 
She used to say ""I love you"" when her children visited and kissed her, but it has now been eight months since they have been able to touch her. Some days, she does not seem to notice when they wave through her bedroom window or dance around with decorative autumn scarecrows to catch her eye. 
""If we could just give her a hug or a kiss on the cheek,"" another daughter, Colleen Mallory, said. ""It's like losing her again and again and again."" 
Life Care has continued to operate throughout the pandemic, though families say its population of 200 patients has ebbed. The initial outbreak that killed dozens of residents and sickened much of the staff has now faded, but families say they still get sporadic notifications of a new infection inside. 
As Ms. Walsh's children chatted at a Starbucks before one morning's visit, their phones suddenly buzzed in unison -- it was a text message from Life Care reporting that one patient and three staff members had tested positive. Life Care Centers of America, which has more than 200 facilities, faces wrongful-death lawsuits from the families of two former Kirkland residents, and federal and state regulators cited lapses in its response to the outbreak. Life Care has disputed the lawsuits and appealed findings by regulators. In September, an administrative law judge in Washington State sided largely with Life Care, saying that the facility had violated some regulations, but that the evidence did not show that care or residents' health had been jeopardized. 
Nancy Butner, northwest division vice president for Life Care, said the Kirkland facility was doing well and was a top-rate facility. ""They are providing a high level of service in a safe environment that ensures peace of mind for our residents and their families,"" she said. 
All told, the virus has infected more than 581,000 people at some 23,000 long-term care facilities, which include nursing homes, assisted living facilities, memory care centers, retirement communities and other care facilities for older adults. 
In the early months of the pandemic, most facilities for older adults banned family and friends from entering their buildings. State and federal regulators issued guidance, restricting visitors and nonessential health care personnel, and canceling communal activities within buildings. In the months since, even as illness and deaths have continued inside some facilities, government restrictions have been eased in many places. Research groups recently reported that thousands of nursing homes were still facing serious shortages of masks, gowns and other equipment. Adding to the risks, nursing home employees are continuing a long-running practice of working in multiple facilities, increasing the chances they could bring the virus from location to location, particularly if the virus spreads more easily this winter. 
Mark Parkinson, president of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, a trade group, said that despite the efforts of facilities to protect residents, they are in large part at the mercy of their surrounding communities. 
For now, a patchwork of state and federal guidelines governs how long-term care facilities are handling visits from family and friends of residents. Some let families inside while many only allow outdoor visits, a dwindling option in colder weather. 
Before, relatives could visit to make sure residents finished lunch and had their teeth brushed. A family member's face and touch can be anchors, experts said, and such a presence helps to engage people's long-term memories. ""Those familiar faces are what our residents rely on in order to determine whether they are in a safe place or not,"" said Dr. Jim Wright, a nursing home medical director in Richmond, Va., who criticized safety conditions at a facility 
where he used to work, following the deaths of 51 residents in the spring. 
Back at the beginning of the pandemic, Charlie Cape could still recognize his wife of 50 years, Linda. Mr. Cape learned he had Alzheimer's disease a decade ago and had spent the past two years at a senior care facility in Sarasota, Fla., where Ms. Cape visited him almost every day. A nurse, she would sometimes help feed him, shower him, shave him and periodically give him a pedicure. 
His weight was stable, she said, about 180 pounds. He could string together some words. He went to gatherings when they were held on his floor, even dancing with his wife to ""My Girl"" before the pandemic. Then the facility stopped allowing visitors. 
Ms. Cape said that she tried to talk with her husband using video chats but that the technology was intimidating. He did not understand how the iPad worked and would look elsewhere or get up and walk away. On such calls between March and August, she could see he was losing weight and withdrawing. He no longer takes part in group activities, she said. It has been months since she could understand anything he was saying. Ms. Cape said she did not blame the facility for banning visitors, adding that she had been impressed with its staff and its communication during the pandemic. The facility, HarborChase, did not respond to interview requests. ""Charlie doesn't know us any more,"" she said in October after seeing him as visits resumed. She and her son go every Sunday with a cookie and a Diet Coke, unless Mr. Cape is sleeping. Sometimes, during these visits, Mr. Cape just sits and cries. 
Some of his decline may be attributable to Alzheimer's, Ms. Cape said, but she believes that the long period of isolation from family accelerated its progress. If nothing else, she feels she missed a crucial period of his life when he still knew who she was. 
""I wish that I had had a little bit more time with him, a bit more quality time,"" she said. ""That's my regret."" A survey of 365 people living inside nursing facilities around the country found that most no longer leave their rooms to socialize. Three in four residents said they felt lonely. 
Susan Hailey, 77, is trying to recover from five months of isolation. She moved into the Life Care Center of Kirkland to recover from knee surgery but contracted the coronavirus and watched as her roommate and her closest friend at the facility died of the virus. She fell twice and began hallucinating that dead people were visiting her. ""I missed talking to my family and touching them, kissing them on the cheek,"" she said. In August, she moved into a small adult-care home where she has begun learning to walk again. She still has cognitive problems, and cannot read mystery novels anymore because she forgets what happened from one paragraph to the next. 
But she says she is happy now, and hopeful, and when her two daughters visited one evening, Ms. Hailey smiled and asked, ""Touch me, will ya?""

211,"Distanceyearning: Florida seniors endure forced isolation of the past seven months, gain wisdom they’ll take with them through the rest of the pandemic","ST. PETERSBURG Bertha Jones hasnt been to Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church since March. The 87-year old misses singing along with her people. 
So she finds a church service on TV every Sunday and worships at home, alone. 
No, not one but my lonely Jesus, she croons from her kitchen table. If I call on Jesus, he will come to our rescue. Jones safely distances from her children and grandchildren, who drop off groceries and visit most days. She calls and writes to those on her list of 11 people who are sick or going through hard times Sister Crosby, Mother Shirley Wright, Teresa Carter giving them encouragement and chatting about life. Shes shut in, but she doesnt want to be shut out. 
Sometimes you can be at peace at home if you want to, she said. 
Seniors are at the highest risk from the coronavirus, and thousands across the country who lived in care facilities have died from it over the past seven months. But millions more, including Jones, have confined themselves to their homes, where theyre safer from the virus, but isolated from so much of life outside their four walls. Two-thirds of U.S. adults report experiencing social isolation, and 66 percent agree that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused their anxiety level to increase, according to an October report by the AARP. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a rise in social isolation and loneliness, reaching epidemic proportions. 
The Tampa Bay Times spoke with six local seniors who shared their stories about and wisdom gained over the past seven months. Theyve endured  
much, but found ways to cope taking piano lessons over Zoom, buying grand pads so they can see their grandchildren online, forming small pods of friends who help them stay sane. 
Jones plans to tend the sweet potatoes in her garden and take mile-long walks through her neighborhood as she waits out the pandemic. 
I enjoy life as it is, she said. I try not to dwell on the worldly stuff. 
Chuck Williams, 63, and his partner Jim Anderson, 71, retired to St. Petersburg a couple of years ago, seeking a warmer lifestyle and a greater sense of community. 
Williams joined a Friday discussion group at Metro Inclusive Health. He met with retired librarians for bi-monthly club meetings. Anderson, a retired engineer, worked on consulting projects. The pair attended neighborhood association meetings, and helped with lake and alley cleanups. 
So I guess what Im saying is, our 2019 calendar was filled, Williams said. But then the pandemic hit. All of a sudden, there was absolutely nothing on our calendar. 
They have chronic underlying health issues, Williams said, so they are staying home. They have their groceries delivered. Theyve eaten out four times since July 1 only outdoors. 
The men are glad they have each other and feel sorry for their single friends. 
Had we been left in Chicago, we would have been stranded in our apartment indoors because of the cold weather, Williams said. Instead, theyve created a bubble of friends who meet outside. 
We have about six to eight people that we see who are being as careful as we are about not unnecessarily exposing ourselves in large groups, Williams said. 
They wear masks, socially distance and gather around a table on the couples patio. They order pizza from local joints and gab. Theyve all stayed safe from the virus so far, but they miss the deeper community theyd just begun to cultivate. 
Weve loosened up considerably, but were still being extremely careful, Williams said. We look at ourselves and consider ourselves very lucky, really lucky. 
Paula Cohen and her husband, Barry Cohen, of New Port Richey have visited their 32-year-old son Gregory every weekend for the past 14 years. 
Theyve picked him up at his group home and driven him straight to McDonalds, where he got his usual a hamburger, french fries and a Diet Coke. 
Hes a big soda boy, Paula Cohen said. My joke is we dont have to get him food, we can just get a 64-oz. bottle with a straw for him. 
The routine is essential for Gregory, who has autism, she said. But Gregorys home went on pandemic lockdown in March, and his retirement-aged parents were unable to visit. The Cohens isolation pain was less theirs than their sons, but all three were suffering. 
It was just miserable, Paula Cohen remembered. And I was going crazy, because hes not used to that ... he has no clue as to what a pandemic is. 
After three weeks, the group home took pity on them, she said, and allowed the couple to bring Gregory fast food to eat on the homes screened-in lanai. 
We sat six feet away in the hot backyard in lawn chairs and wearing masks, she said. He needed to see us, and we needed to see him. 
Sometimes, the visits ended in tears. Gregory would beg them to come inside and get upset when his parents explained why they couldnt. His mother would cry on her way back to the car. 
Gregorys obsessive compulsive disorder got worse in the weeks he was stuck at his home, she said. And he gained back the weight his parents had recently helped him lose. 
Its just so frustrating, because we had been at a really great point before the pandemic, she said. He put on a good 20-plus pounds, just from all that laying around. 
The trio are back to regular visits now, she said, but it will take a lot of Saturday walks to get the weight off. 
Before the pandemic lockdown, Denise Donohue, 61, visited her 91-year-old mother Rosalie Tobias every day. Tobias had moved into The Barrington, an independent- and assisted-living facility in Largo, in December when her health worsened. 
They used to go to Donohues house and hang out, or go out for lunch and eat eggplant parmesan. Then the pandemic hit, and Donohue wasnt able to visit her mom for months to help her with her medicine or show her pictures of her grandkids. 
So now with this isolation bit, what Im afraid of for her and for others, is that theyre getting so used to the idea of being alone, that this is becoming acceptable behavior to stay in and just be sad, Donohue said. Donohue has limited her trips away from home to reduce her risk of carrying the virus to her mother. And she recently became an essential caregiver at The Barrington, a designation that lets her help Tobias with daily living tasks. She does what she can to cheer her up on afternoon visits three times a week, but sometimes it doesnt work. 
I said to her yesterday, if you were able to go out what would you want to do? Donohue said. And she didnt really have a response for me. But just the fact that she cant go out just makes her irritable and sad at the same time. Donohue finds herself crying, often for no reason. She has leaned on the Caregivers for Compromise discussion group on Facebook for support. Shes reminded that she needs to take care of herself. 
I find myself being more emotional now than I should be at 61, Donohue said. I want to spend every moment with her that I can, and I just want them to be happy moments. 
Kristine Littrell longs to see her great-grandson, Archer. She hasnt held him since last December, when he was 2 weeks old. Now hes almost a year old. 
The older you get, the more family connections you feel, and you dont want to miss anything, she said. Littrell, 71, and her husband Paul Littrell, 77, usually fly or drive from Sun City Center to New York or Chicago over the summer to visit some of their five children and 15 grandchildren. But it didnt happen this year, because they thought the travel was so risky. 
We do keep in touch with all of our friends and family as best we can, Kristine Littrell said. We have Zoom, and we have FaceTime, but its not the same thing. 
Pauls two brothers in Michigan died in recent months, and Kristines cousin passed away in Rochester, but they couldnt go to the memorial services. 
So to be isolated from those kinds of events has been very sad, she said. 
Time seems to just fly, she said. But when I talk to my grandchildren, their sense of time is different. This has seemed like forever to them. And I suppose for us, its gone by faster. 
The Littrells have continued with their hobbies but from home. Paul takes photos, quilts, bakes, keeps up with politics and reads. Kristine takes piano lessons over Zoom, her computer propped up behind her so her teacher can watch her hands. 
So its not that were bored, she said. Its just that we miss our regular life.",11/1/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,3,both risks and benefits,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,6
215,Heart: A Danger From Social Isolation: [Science Desk],"Women who are socially isolated have an increased risk for high blood pressure, researchers report. But men, not so much. 
Scientists used data on 28,238 Canadian men and women aged 45 to 85 who are participating in a large continuing study on aging. 
The researchers found that compared with married women, single women had a 28 percent higher risk of hypertension, divorced women a 21 percent higher risk, and widowed women a 33 percent higher risk. Social connections were also significant. Compared with the one-quarter of women with the largest social networks -- which ranged from 220 to 573 people -- those in the lowest one-quarter, with fewer than 85 connections, were 15 percent more likely to have high blood pressure. 
The associations were different, and generally weaker, in men. Men who lived alone had a lower risk of hypertension than men with partners, but the size of men's social networks, or their participation in social activity, was not significantly associated with high blood pressure. 
The study, in the Journal of Hypertension, controlled for many factors that affect blood pressure, including age, education, smoking, alcohol use and depression.",11/10/20,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
217,Teens in COVID Isolation: ‘I Felt Like I Was Suffocating’,"In this lesson, students learn why a loss of social ties is especially severe for teenagers, then consider how to cope both now and when the pandemic is over. 
Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021. Lesson Overview 
Featured Article: “Teens in Covid Isolation: ‘I Felt Like I Was Suffocating’” 
Anxiety and depression among adolescents have increased during the coronavirus pandemic, and experts express heightened concerns about their mental health. A major reason teenagers are being disproportionately affected? Isolation from their friends. 
In this lesson, students will first think about the role friendships play in adolescence, and how that role may be different than at other stages of life. They will then read a piece that describes the experiences of many different young people, and learn what experts suggest they can do to cope. Finally, they can choose from two “going further” activities to either think strategically about how their generation as a whole may be affected by the pandemic long-term, or consider ways to strengthen friendships, even in isolation. 
Teachers: This article concerns sensitive subject matter. Please make sure it is suitable for your students, either to read alone or to discuss as a class assignment. 
Warm Up 
What role do your friends play in your life? Make a list, or discuss this question with someone else your age. If your friendships have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, think back to before the pandemic to answer this question. Why are your friends important to you? How do they help you? What do they add to your life? The article you’re about to read is about why the coronavirus pandemic has been especially hard on teenagers, and one of the main reasons the article identifies is isolation from friends. But given that people of all ages are isolated from their friends right now, why do you think that, according to experts on adolescent development and mental health, the loss of social contact is especially detrimental to people your age? 
Look back at the list you made about your own friends, and try to guess some of the reasons you think these experts will give. 
Questions for Writing and Discussion 
Read the article, then answer the following questions: 
1. What was Aya Raji’s life like before the pandemic, and what is it like now? Can you relate to this description? Do you feel your life has been dramatically altered in the same way? 
2. What does research show about the role of friendships in teenagers’ lives? How many teens reported feeling unhappy or depressed in recent months in the study this paragraph quotes? Does that seem about right to you in thinking about the teenagers you know? 
3. What are some warning signs of anxiety or depression listed in this article? 
4. In the Warm Up section above, we asked you why friendships in the teenage years might be more critical than in other years. According to this piece, “as stressful as adolescent relationships can be, they are also essential for the formation of personal identity.” Do you agree with that? Have your friends helped you with the formation of your 
personal identity? If so, how?

Going Further 
Option 1: Planning Ahead for Long-Term Effects on a Generation 
According to the article, “Researchers have begun investigating how today’s high school students will bear the long-term consequences of the pandemic, in terms of their education and economic futures.” What predictions can you make about how your generation will be affected? Do you think all of the effects will be negative, or will some good come out of this period of isolation, too? Why? How could individuals like parents, teachers, coaches and therapists, as well as institutions like high schools, colleges and workplaces, help when the pandemic is over? What could they do to mitigate some of these consequences, or even to restore some of what has been lost for your generation this year? 
Option 2: Strengthen Your Relationships, Even in Isolation 
In October, we asked students, “Are You Having a Tough Time Maintaining Friendships These Days?” Nearly 300 teenagers have answered so far, and you might scroll through their responses to see if your experiences are reflected —or, post your own answer since the forum is still open. 
But you might also like to read the article that inspired that question, “How to Deal With a Friendship ‘Quiet Season.’” First of all, the piece points out that it’s normal right now to have friendships that are strained. But it also suggests ways to think about or work on those relationships. What advice here resonates with you? Might you try any of it?

219,What We Can Learn From Solitude,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, Paul Fredette and Karen Karper Fredette have made some changes to their lives: Ms. Fredette stopped attending her local exercise class, and the couple whittled their interactions with their neighbors down to waves. 
But in many ways, seclusion comes naturally to them. From a house they call Still Wood, nestled in the slope of a mountain surrounded by hundreds of acres of wild woodlands, the Fredettes live their lives “oriented towards solitude,” which is their preferred way of saying that they’re hermits: devoted to simplicity, silence and prayer. The nearest town, Hot Springs, N.C., is 18 miles away and has a population just under 600. 
Mr. Fredette, 71, is a former Catholic priest, while Ms. Fredette, 78, spent 30 years in a monastery after high school before leaving to live as a hermit in a cabin in West Virginia. Since 1996, the couple has overseen a social network for hermits and the hermit-curious called Raven’s Bread Ministries. They provide spiritual counseling to seekers of 
solitude, write books on the topic, run a website and deliver a quarterly newsletter, Raven’s Bread, which includes contributions from the greater hermit community. 
The original idea for Raven’s Bread Ministries was to validate hermits’ attraction to solitude. But this summer the Fredettes felt called to minister to a different demographic: those struggling with the isolation of the coronavirus pandemic. After noticing their average daily website hits went from around 800 pre-pandemic to up to 2,000 in August, the Fredettes began creating YouTube videos. Listening to them feels a bit like getting a very quiet pep talk from your grandparents, or watching an unusually spiritual A.S.M.R. video. 
“A lot of people are going to be in pain, and if you know there’s something you can do to alleviate some of that pain, do it,” Ms. Fredette said. 
In addition to “affirming and supporting” hermits, the Fredettes serve as unofficial spokespeople on their behalf, dispelling the Unabomber stereotype that looms large in the public imagination. Like everything these days, hermits exist on a wide spectrum and prefer a variety of identifiers: lovers of solitude, solitaries, contemplatives. (Ms. Fredette likes to add “contemporary” as a qualifier, to make the lifestyle sound less antiquated.) Although some version of the solitary exists in nearly every religious tradition, eremitism is most commonly associated with the early Christian Desert Fathers and Mothers of the third and fourth centuries. Academics have found interest in eremitical life to be tied to the strength of centralized ecclesiastical institutions at the time, as well as increasing industrialization and urbanization. 
Today, there are hermits who have been officially professed by their respective religious institutions —in Catholicism they are called “canonical hermits” —and rogue hermits who answer to no spiritual authority. There are hermits who live in caves, like the Himalayan Hermit, who spends his summers in a mountain crevice 10,000 feet above Gangotri, India. But many more hide in plain sight, in suburbs and cities. 
The Real Life of a Hermit 
Hermits have never been quite as isolated as many assume: They have often attracted devotees and have always had to earn their own living, which means allowing for some contact with the outside world. Contemporary hermits might take jobs that require little human interaction, like cleaning houses. They try to fill what extra time they have with spiritual practice, rather than social interaction, in person or online, and make choices that support that end: They’ll meditate on their commute rather than read the news, or only answer their 
phone during designated hours. 
They can live anywhere, but tend to reside in modest dwellings and avoid moving around unnecessarily. Nevertheless, a hermit should also not be confused with a recluse. The difference, Ms. Fredette said, is that hermits do not exit society because of misanthropy. “I would define a hermit or a person who chooses solitude as one who chooses solitude for spiritual reasons,” Ms. Fredette said, “and we do accent the spiritual, but it can be any form of spiritual.” 
Despite the hermit’s religious origin, a surprising number of subscribers to Raven’s Bread describe themselves as “formerly” religious and say they don’t affiliate with a particular church or faith group. 
The topics of the Fredettes’s videos are wide-ranging: Sometimes the couple encourages viewers to journal their worries, sometimes they mirror back feelings of despair and anger, and sometimes they relay comparable experiences from their own lives, such as when Ms. Fredette had to miss family gatherings while cloistered at the monastery. 
They lead mini-guided meditations and quote solitary luminaries like Thomas Merton and Julian of Norwich, a medieval mystic who lived through the Black Death and civil unrest. The Fredettes also touch upon the events of our day, like racial injustice and climate change. “We’re not separated from what’s going on around us,” Ms. Fredette said. 
Can Anyone Embrace Solitude? 
Hermits themselves are torn on the issue. 
“Solitude is not like protein,” said Heidi Haverkamp, a Raven’s Bread subscriber and the author of “Holy Solitude: Lenten Reflections With Saints, Hermits, Prophets, and Rebels,” who describes herself as a part-time solitary. “Some people find what I get from solitude in music or in exercise, just different ways that they access the transcendent.” 
Several people pointed out that solitude for them is more a tool than simply a comfortable loneliness. “Solitude is a means,” said John Backman, a writer and “quasi-hermit” who affiliates with both Zen Buddhism and Christianity. “It is a means to draw closer to, immerse oneself in, that or who which is larger than we are, to immerse ourselves in Spirit, as it were.” 
But the Fredettes and other hermits believe that anyone could benefit from incorporating some eremitic fundamentals —such as being rooted in place, practicing austerity and committing to a daily schedule that prioritizes prayer or meditation —to help them make sense of their isolation into their lives, regardless of personality type, religiosity, or life circumstances. 
For people with little to no background in hermit spirituality, the pandemic has proved the ideal entryway. Karthik Kotturu, 27, of Gurugram, India, who described himself as spiritual but not religious, said that after an initial rocky adjustment to lockdown life, he found solace in the teachings of Zen Buddhism. 
“The pandemic made me realize how afraid I was of being alone,” he wrote in an email. Discovering the Zen idea of detaching from the world —in the words of the Tao, eliminating both “longing and aversion” —helped him to shift his perspective. “Once I started seeing what I already had, my desires to seek something from outside started decreasing.” 
Others have found that the situation has allowed them to tap into a love of solitude that was always present but neglected because of life obligations. Hannah Sheldon-Dean, 32, a writer and editor living in Brooklyn, said her morning chores have become a slow, calming routine, and she always ends her days by listening “Harry Potter and the Sacred Text,” a podcast in which the hosts do a deep read of the Rowling series, sometimes utilizing Lectio Divina principles, a Christian style of reading which involves approaching a text in four unhurried stages: read, meditate, pray, contemplate. 
“I’ve always had ritualistic and contemplative tendencies like the ones the hermits describe, but the pandemic has just given them more space to flourish,” Ms. Sheldon-Dean said. 
Some contemporary hermits say prayer and meditation can be done while simultaneously engaging in other activities. And all the hermits interviewed described experiencing a psychological dredging process in the early 
days of their solitude (they described the emotions that came up as “junk” or “sludge”) and emerging as evangelists for self-love. 
“When we’re alone, all the fears and worries and anxieties come up, because we can’t distract ourselves,” said Sister Elizabeth Wagner, a canonical hermit who lives in her own “cell” on the grounds of a communal hermitage in Central Maine. “The great way to be with ourselves, to embrace who we are, warts, bumps, lumps and all, is to breathe.” 
Ms. Fredette said that the understanding that your own “deeper self” is always beside you is the key to transforming anxiety-ridden isolation into nurturing solitude. “Once you begin to talk to yourself, know yourself, then you realize you’re not alone.” 
Nature’s Divinity 
The most potent grounding force of all, many hermits said, is nature. Hermitic life and environmentalism are natural bedfellows: Hermits generally travel infrequently —the term “anchorite” refers specifically to a religious solitary who takes a vow to remain in one place, though even non-anchorite hermits tend to be homebodies —and eschew rabid consumerism. 
Awe in the face of the natural world runs like a thread through the history of eremitism, from the pastoral poems of the Yuan dynasty hermit Stonehouse right up to the work of the Charles Brandt, the Vancouver Island priest-hermit who fought tirelessly for the preservation of the streams and forests around the cabin he called Merton House. Today, some hermits just walk around in a patch of grass, something Sister Rachel Denton, a canonical hermit in Sheffield, England, called “prayer walking.” She also picks up litter in the public park across the street from her home, a community service she calls her “penance.” 
“I suppose there’s a therapy in there as well,” said Sister Denton. “Your body doing the walking, doing the pacing, it’s like a mantra.” 
Alternatively, some hermits make friends with nature, like the Fredettes have. 
“We have a rock, a huge rock, that’s sticking out of the mountains,” Ms. Fredette said. “Her name is Petra. And we have a path that leads right out to Petra. And when things are difficult I go out and I lean on Petra, and I say, ‘Give me some guidance.’”",11/27/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,both risks and benefits,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,3,4
220,"Low-income seniors feeling the pandemic; Many spend days alone in rooms, with food delivery their only human contact.","Evelyn Rogers loved going to the Potiker Family Senior Residence in downtown San Diego to join a friend in a singing group, do arts and crafts, work on a computer and socialize with others. 
""You could stay for hours and play videos or play the piano,"" recalled Rogers, 60. ""But we're not allowed to do anything anymore. We can't have fun with other people."" 
The Potiker Family Senior Residence and the Gary and Mary West Senior Wellness Center, both operated by the nonprofit Serving Seniors, discontinued their in-person classes and activities in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Paul Downey, president and CEO of Serving Seniors, said the move was made to protect the health of the clients they serve. But it also came with a cost. 
""Aside from, obviously, the health implications of catching COVID, the single biggest impact of this is the social isolation,"" he said. ""On a typical day at the wellness center, we'd have 500 and 600 people come through. They could do travel classes, tai chi, yoga, chair aerobics, go to the cyber cafe, a singing group or do art projects."" That all ended in March. Now, a room that once saw the same friends meeting daily for meals is used for packing food into boxes for delivery, a service that grew from 60,000 deliveries a month to 220,000 to help seniors who are shut in. 
For some, the quick handoff of the packaged meals five days a week is one of the few interactions they have with another person. 
""There's not much to do, due to the COVID,"" Rogers said. ""Just stay home and wait for my food."" In response to the isolation many seniors are experiencing, Serving Seniors has created Connections, a program in which volunteers call homebound seniors three days a week to chat and check up on them. The nonprofit isn't alone in recognizing the plight of many seniors during the pandemic. The San Diego Seniors Community Foundation this year launched a $1-million No Senior Alone initiative and has provided about $200,000 in grants to various organizations to address the issue. 
Samond Hayes, 21, is one of the Serving Seniors delivery drivers who bring food to people's homes. Rogers is among about 100 people on his route, which covers 13 buildings. 
""Serving Seniors,"" Hayes says as he knocks on each door on his route. People usually answer with a heartfelt smile and thank Hayes, although some are bedridden and ask him to come inside. 
On Tuesday, he delivered a warm Salisbury steak dinner and bags with breakfast and lunch. There would be no deliveries on Thanksgiving, but Wednesday's delivery would include turkey for clients to enjoy on the holiday. His first stop was to a disabled woman who lives at Lions Community Manor. 
""One time I went in and she was on the floor,"" Hayes said, revealing that sometimes his job involves more than just food delivery. ""I had to help her up."" 
At the Sara Frances Hometel, client Judy Trotter, 77, also said she does little outside her room these days. ""I don't really do nothing,"" she said. ""I got out if I go to the store or if I go to the doctor or the bank. But other than 
that, I'm inside."" 
Trotter's isolation isn't because of COVID-19, which she said she isn't worried about. Rather, it's her own lifestyle choice. 
Michael Stone, who also lives at the Sara Frances Hometel, said that at 66 he is concerned about catching COVID 19, so he spends much of his day watching Netflix and cable TV at home. 
""I don't want to catch this thing,"" he said. ""I have to be around for the ones who love me. I don't go anywhere. I don't do anything too much. My life is very bland, but I'm alive and I'm safe."" 
Stone is known in the local music scene as Stoney B. As leader of the Stoney B Blues Band, he used to play four gigs a week. With the shutdown, he's played four shows since March, including two that were livestreamed for safety reasons. 
""We were just happy as hell to be playing somewhere together,"" he said. 
Though some clients said they were going stir-crazy, others said they had adapted. 
""It could be worse,"" said Tom Treher, a Horton House resident who will turn 74 on Dec. 4. ""Much of my life has been here in my apartment anyway, listening to sports shows. I keep myself active. I still do floor exercise and that sort of thing. I play guitar a little bit."" 
Treher is blind, but he goes shopping on his own. He used to go to the Blind Community Center but now participates in the organization's virtual classes. 
""I have Spanish on Monday and French on Friday,"" he said. ""There's trivia on Wednesday and bingo on Friday."" As for person-to-person contact, Treher said that's limited to Hayes, people he meets in the lobby and others he meets while shopping. 
At the Golden West Hotel, Serving Seniors client Richard Parker, 70, also said he does not feel isolated because of the shutdown. 
""I have a very nice mountain bike and ride as much as I can,"" he said. ""I stay away from most people."" Parker said he is taking the pandemic seriously. 
""This virus, whatever is going around, is no joke,"" he said. ""I've been watching the news. I'm coping with it."" Fellow Golden West resident Kenneth Gerber, 74, said he used to go to the Gary and Mary West Wellness Center for meals but not for other activities, so its shutdown didn't affect him much. 
Still, life has been more boring this year, he said. 
""There ain't really much to do,"" he said. ""I go out and take walks, but that's about it. I used to like to take off and go all over the place, but ain't nothing open no more, hardly."" 
Margarita Morales, 64, lives at the Peachtree Inn and said the shutdown has been especially frustrating for her mother, 91, who lives with her and used to like to go shopping. 
""I used to take my mom out,"" she said. ""We used to go out and eat. We can't do that anymore. Now we can memorize this room by heart. I can close my eyes and know where everything is at."" 
Morales said she bought beads for her mother to make bracelets as a way of keeping busy. Looking forward to cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving, she thought of how things could be worse. 
""I'm thankful no one in my family has gotten the coronavirus, and I'm thankful for having a roof over my head and clothes on my back,"" she said.",11/28/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,neither,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,4
221,"In Europe's Nursing Homes, a Soaring Covid-19 Death Toll and the Pain of Isolation; Many facilities on the continent resist isolating residents, saying prolonged solitude is also harmful","PARIS—The coronavirus has resurged in Europe's nursing homes, killing thousands of older people and forcing facilities to make a difficult choice: impose another period of crushing isolation or risk greater exposure to the virus. 
Nursing home outbreaks have dashed hopes that their residents could be shielded from the virus when it is spreading quickly in society at large. As cases soared across Europe this fall , nursing home personnel and visitors brought the virus in with them despite strict sanitary rules, infecting tens of thousands of residents, who are most vulnerable to the pathogen because of their age and frailty. 
Countries such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands that closely track nursing home deaths have recorded more than 9,000 since the beginning of October. Other nations such as Italy and Spain that don't yet have data on nursing home deaths have reported outbreaks in hundreds of facilities in recent weeks. In France, one of the hardest hit countries during Europe's second wave, 71,000 residents of nursing homes and other care facilities have tested positive for the virus since the beginning of October. More than 5000 residents have died in the facilities during the second wave, and another 1,500 died after being transferred to hospitals. Around 22,000 residents have died since the start of the pandemic, rivaling the per capita nursing-home death toll in the U.S., where more than 100,000 nursing home residents have died , according to a Wall Street Journal tally. France locked down nursing homes during the first pandemic wave in the spring, when more than 14,000 residents died. This time, the government has allowed visits to continue to avoid the physical and mental decline that can set in after an extended period of isolation. Depression and cognitive problems among residents surged during the first lockdown, while their physical condition deteriorated from being largely confined to their rooms, health authorities said. 
However, many nursing homes decided individually to bar visitors and confine residents during the second wave, after being hit with outbreaks. 
After France lifted its first lockdown in May, Claude Debeda, 80, received regular visits from two of his daughters, who live near his nursing home in Dieulefit, a town in southeastern France in the foothills of the Alps. Then dozens of residents tested positive for the virus in the fall, prompting the facility to lock down three weeks ago. ""It's like a prison,"" Mr. Debeda said. ""We have no conversation with other residents. We're completely isolated in our rooms."" 
Mr. Debeda's daughters are lobbying him to move out of the facility, but he doesn't want to deal with the disruption. 
""I want the rules to be relaxed and that at least we can go into the halls and walk,"" he said. ""Imagine, it's been three weeks, and I practically haven't walked."" 
Some French nursing homes that have taken a less strict approach have seen the virus decimate their residents. At Les Vergers, a nursing home in Noyarey, a town in the Alps, the coronavirus has killed 24 residents since the beginning of October, a third of the facility's total, said director Dominique Gerbi. 
She decided to keep visits in place despite the infections. Masks are required at all times in the facility for staff and visitors. But many residents are suffering from cognitive problems and are incapable of wearing a mask properly during visits, she said. Residents and their visitors aren't supposed to touch each other, but that restriction, too, is difficult to enforce. 
""Many residents don't understand these rules, so they spontaneously go to touch their families, who have difficulty refusing this contact,"" Ms. Gerbi said. 
She doesn't regret continuing to allow visits during the second wave. 
""The first confinement was brutal and detrimental for the residents,"" she said. ""It worsened cognitive problems and made them physically more dependent."" 
The virus has entered nursing homes despite staff being much better equipped with masks and other protective equipment than in March, when gear was in short supply and some authorities advised against wearing masks. Widespread testing for the virus—which was unavailable during the first wave—has also failed to stop contagion. ""We're not lacking sanitary gel, we're not lacking masks, blouses or gloves,"" said Philippe Marissal, a doctor who practices in two nursing homes in southeast France that have been hit with outbreaks. ""Despite all this, the virus has entered again…we're missing something."" 
A new round of outbreaks in nursing homes in Spain has put the system there under severe stress. After mass deaths in nursing homes during the spring, Spanish facilities are buckling under staffing shortages and additional sanitary rules to prevent outbreaks. 
""People are not aware of the speed we need to work at,"" said Juani Peñafiel, head of Madrid nursing-home workers at the CCOO labor union. ""We just don't have time to take care of the residents properly."" In Italy, which suffered a wave of nursing home deaths linked to coronavirus in the spring, deaths are surging again in the facilities. Excess mortality has been the highest in Europe in recent weeks, according to Euromomo, which monitors mortality rates across the region. 
The Italian government doesn't yet have data on how many of those deaths are among nursing home residents, but some regions are reporting infections in hundreds of the facilities. In the northeastern Veneto region, more than 200 nursing homes had outbreaks, compared with just 60 facilities during the first wave of the pandemic, said Roberto Volpe, president of an association of nursing homes in Veneto that groups around 340 care centers. During the first lockdown, infections were limited among personnel because Italy's lockdown was so strict, Mr. Volpe said. Now, more nursing home personnel are infecting the residents. 
""Every employee goes back home, lives with people who go out too, may have kids who go to school and so can be infected outside of the nursing home,"" he said. ""Then they carry the virus inside the nursing home."" Bans on visits since October have prompted an outcry from residents and their families. Even before then, in some cases, visits were allowed during the summer only in nursing homes that had gardens, as relatives weren't allowed to enter the buildings. 
""They are depressed, cry and feel abandoned,"" said Barbara Mezzio, from Verona. She said that until recently she was allowed to see her father from outside the nursing home where he is staying, through the thick glass of the entrance door. But after a cleaning person and another employee tested positive, she isn't allowed to see her father even this way. 
""The guests are desperate. Many just don't understand why their children cannot visit them,"" said Laura Aspromonte, who chairs an association grouping the relatives of 75 nursing homes in Lombardy.

This visual project, initiated with the Magnum Foundation, supported by the Henry Luce Foundation, gives us a glimpse through these photographers' lenses. 
Fatima Alnassr was always abundantly cheerful. At age 90, the Saudi woman still recited poems and joked with her grandchildren, and she offered witticisms and advice to visitors who surrounded her bed each day. The coronavirus pandemic left her alone, the silence hanging heavy in her bedroom. ""She kept asking when the lockdown and covid would leave so her life can go back to normal,"" said her eldest son, Hussain. For half a year, the only people she saw were her sons and daughters when they dropped off groceries. She went mute for her final three months. Depression had replaced her joy. 
One day, after six months of near-absolute isolation, she took a long breath and faded, her son recalled. Her children took her to the hospital, where they found out that her heart had stopped, though no particular ailment was diagnosed. 
Although she had tested negative for the coronavirus, her children say they believe it killed her - not the virus itself, but the forced isolation that sapped her of laughter. 
Fatima wanted to be buried not with family members but with her friends. Adhering to public health guidelines on crowds, only 50 people were able to gather to pay their respects. Hundreds expressed their love in online messages and calls.

224,Pandemic pushes caregivers to limits: Tampa Bay area agencies say people who care for loved ones with ailments have been struggling with burnout and isolation since the coronavirus hit Florida. It has caused a growing need for support so they can find time to relax or get away,"HUDSON Vicki Martinez struggles to find an uninterrupted moment at the end of the day to use a CBD face mask or listen to the birds off her lanai. 
The 65-year-old has taken care of her husband, Lee, 70, for the past three years as his Alzheimers and dementia have progressed. Before the coronavirus pandemic, she went to weekly networking meetings for her jewelry business and took her husband to car shows. 
Now she hardly leaves their Hudson home or his side. 
I just get angry in general because I feel like my whole life has just been ripped out from under me, Martinez said. But then I look at him, and I think his lifes been ripped out from under him, too. 
For both, its hard to fight the frustration with no visitors and no family nearby. 
Martinez is one of more than 2.9 million people in Florida who care for loved ones with Alzheimers, dementia and other ailments, according to AARP. For many who care for ailing loved ones, the pandemic-induced isolation has increased the stress and loneliness they felt before COVID-19 hit in March. 
Many of these caregivers dont have nearby family, so they alone have to navigate their loved ones finances, medical needs, medicines and care for their home, said Eileen Poiley, director of education at the University of South Florida Health Byrd Alzheimers Institute. 
Now they have to manage COVID and manage a whole new aspect of health, Poiley said. Its going to increase their level of stress, because they have so much to deal with, as well as the isolation. 
Many caregivers and their loved ones are in the age group most vulnerable to the coronavirus, so they are unable to go out, said Kathleen Winters, director of the Alzheimers Family Organization, a nonprofit based in Spring Hill. Winters organization hosts 48 support groups for caregivers across eight Florida counties, which are hosting socially distant and virtual meetings. Caregivers who were attending support groups before the pandemic likely were comfortable joining meetings via Zoom, she said, but those who were new or didnt know people in the groups were less likely to participate during the pandemic-induced lockdown. 
Winters office is receiving more calls from caregivers who simply want to talk to someone or get quick advice. Prior to COVID-19, the office might get one or two calls a week. Now theyre getting them every day, Winters said. Caregivers in Hillsborough County can reach out to the Senior Connection Center in Tampa for information about state or federal funding for respite care. The amount varies by the persons need, said Patty Suarez, spokesperson for the center. 
The Area Agency on Aging of Pasco-Pinellas runs a caregiver support program for residents who care for loved ones, said Executive Director Ann Marie Winter. The agency assigns each caller to a specialist who assesses their needs and sets up assistance. The program also provides services that could include mental health counseling for the caregiver. 
There has been an increase in demand for the program, Winter said. The office has hired an additional specialist, expanding service to another 50 people. 
But thats not enough to address the wait list, she said. Theres just not enough funding to address the needs of caregivers. 
In 2020, the agency has served 149 caregivers, according to Winter. But 283 caregivers were on the waiting list as 
of Nov. 18 93 in Pasco County and 190 in Pinellas County. 
The agencys specialists point out respite care agencies that allow the caregiver to go shopping, sit on the beach or get some perspective and a moment to relax, she said. 
Winters office helps place seniors with dementia-related disorders in day care programs that allow their caregivers time to run errands and spend a few hours alone a few days a week. Those programs are opening back up, she said. 
But many of those caregivers were home with their seniors for a really long time during the lockdown, she said. Caregivers may call the state Area Agencies on Aging at 1-800-963-5337.",12/5/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,2
225,Seniors form COVID pods to ward off isolation: Expert opinions differ on whether it's safe or not,"Over the past month, Dr. Richard Besdine and his wife have been discussing whether to see family and friends indoors this fall and winter. 
He thinks they should, so long as people have been taking strict precautions during the coronavirus pandemic.
She’s not convinced it’s safe, given the heightened risk of viral transmission in indoor spaces. 
Both are well positioned to weigh in on the question. Besdine, 80, was the longtime director of the division of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Brown University’s Alpert Medical School. His wife, Terrie Wetle, 73, also an aging specialist, was the founding dean of Brown’s School of Public Health. 
“We differ, but I respect her hesitancy, so we don’t argue,” Besdine said. 
Older adults in all kinds of circumstances — those living alone and those who are partnered, those in good health and those who are not — are similarly deliberating what to do as days and nights turn chilly and coronavirus cases rise across the country. 
Some are forming “bubbles” or “pods”: small groups that agree on pandemic precautions and will see one another in person in the months ahead. Others are planning to go it alone. 
Judith Rosenmeier, 84, of Boston, a widow who’s survived three bouts of breast cancer, doesn’t intend to invite friends to her apartment or visit them in theirs. 
“My oncologist said when all this started, ‘You really have to stay home more than other people because the treatments you’ve had have destroyed a lot of your immune defenses,’” she said. 
Since mid-March, Rosenmeier has been outside only three times: once, in September, to go to the eye doctor and twice since to walk with a few friends. After living in Denmark for most of her adult life, she doesn’t have a lot of close contacts. Her son lives in Edinburgh, Scotland. 
“There’s a good chance I’ll be alone on Thanksgiving and on Christmas, but I’ll survive,” she said.
A friend who lives nearby, Joan Doucette, 82, is determined to maintain in-person social contacts. With her husband, Harry Fisher, 84, she’s formed a “pod” with two other couples in her nine-unit apartment building. All are members of Beacon Hill Village, an organization that provides various services to seniors aging in place. Doucette sees her pod almost every day. 
“We’re always running up and down the stairs or elevator and bringing each other cookies or soup,” she said. “I don’t think I would have survived this pandemic without that companionship.” 
About once a week, the couples have dinner together and “we don’t wear masks,” said Jerry Fielder, 74, who moved to Boston two years ago with his partner, Daniel, 73. But he said he feels safe because “we know where everyone goes and what they do: We’re all on the same page. We go out for walks every day, all of us. Otherwise, we’re very careful.” 
Eleanor Weiss, 86, and her husband are also members of the group. “I wear a mask, I socially distance myself, but I don’t isolate myself,” Weiss said. This winter, she said, she’ll see “a few close friends” and three daughters who live in the Boston area. 
One daughter is hosting Thanksgiving at her house, and everyone will get tested for the coronavirus beforehand. “We’re all careful. We don’t hug and kiss. We do the elbow thing,” Weiss said. 
In Chicago, Arthur Koff, 85, and his wife, Norma, 69, don’t yet have plans for Thanksgiving or Christmas. “It’s up in the air depending on what’s happening with the virus,” he said. The couple has a wide circle of friends. 
“I think it’s going to be a very hard winter,” said Koff, who has diabetes and blood cancer. He doesn’t plan to go to restaurants but hopes to meet some friends he trusts inside their homes or apartments when the weather turns bad.
Julie Freestone, 75, and her husband, Rudi Raab, 74, are “pretty fanatic” about staying safe during the pandemic. The couple invited six friends over for “Thanksgiving in October” earlier this month — outside, in their backyard in Richmond, California. 
“Instead of a seating chart, this year I had a plating chart and I plated everything in advance,” Freestone said. “I asked everybody to tell me what they wanted — White or dark meat? Brussels sprouts or broccoli?” 
Dr. Richard Besdine, a former director of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Brown University, and his wife, Terrie Wetle, the founding dean of the university’s School of Public Health, are experts in aging and public health. But they haven’t come to terms yet on how to deal with the risks of socializing in the coming winter months, due to the pandemic. He thinks they should, as long as precautions are in place. She’s not convinced it’s safe. (Dr. Richard Besdine).
This winter, Freestone isn’t planning to see people inside, but she’ll visit with people in groups, virtually. One is her monthly women’s group, which has been getting together over Zoom. “In some ways, I feel we’ve reached a new level of intimacy because people are struggling with so many issues — and we’re all talking about that,” she said. 
“I think you need to redefine bubbles,” said Freestone, who’s on the board of Ashby Village, a Berkeley, California-based organization for seniors aging in place that’s hosting lots of virtual groups. “It should be something you feel a part of, but it doesn’t have to be people who come into your house.” 
In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in Minnesota, two psychologists — Leni de Mik, 79, and Brenda Hartman, 65 — are calling attention to what they call SILOS, an acronym for “single individuals left out of social circles,” and their need for dependable social contact this winter and fall. 
They recommend that older adults in this situation reach out to others with similar interests — people they may have met at church or in book clubs or art classes, for instance — and try to form a group. Similarly, they recommend that families or friends invite a single older friend into their pods or bubbles. 
“Look around at who’s in your community. Who used to come to your house that you haven’t seen? Reach out,” de Mik recommended. 
Both psychologists are single and live alone. De Mik’s pod will include two friends who are “super careful outside,” as she is. Hartman’s will include her sister, 67, and her father, 89, who also live alone. Because her daughter works in an elementary school, she’ll see her only outside. Also, she’ll be walking regularly with two friends over the winter. 
“COVID brings life and death right up in front of us,” Hartman said, “and when that happens, we have the opportunity to make crucial choices — the opportunity to take care of each other.”",12/6/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,neither,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,1

Family Recipes, Flexibility and Online Connections Can Help; How people across the U.S. are dealing with a more solitary holiday season","This article is part of "" Life in Quarantine ,"" dispatches from around the world about how people are getting through the coronavirus pandemic. The fourth installment looks at holidays during Covid-19, including reinventing traditions and staying safe . 
Loving Memories Help After Tragic Loss of Husband and Mother 
Taking time to heal and remember past holidays together; Alberta Sparks' secret ingredient Maria McCoy, 53, Greater Orlando, Fla. 
Profession: Retired teacher launching a new business 
What are you most thankful for? ""I am thankful that I had the opportunity to have both of my loved ones who passed away in 2020 in my life for the time I had them. Both of them had a special love for all family. Their memories will definitely live on in the family."" 
Maria McCoy's parents raised her to be independent and strong—traits which helped when she lost her husband of 11 years in September to Covid-19. Now she faces the next hurdle: her first Christmas without her mom, who died before the pandemic in February. 
""My mom was the one who made sure the family stayed together,"" says Dr. McCoy, 53, a retired middle-school teacher with a Ed.D. in education. 
Dr. McCoy is planning to spend the holiday as usual at her younger brother's house in Miami, where some 30 family members will gather. But she will make the 3½ hour drive south alone this year. She expects there will be the customary big tree surrounded by hundreds of presents that will be eagerly distributed by the youngest children. Due to Covid, the celebration will be outside with each household separated by a table. They will still stand in a circle, but they won't hold hands. Dr. McCoy's preacher husband, Will McCoy, won't be leading the prayer. 
Dr. McCoy has turned to travel to help the healing process, being careful to follow all Covid safety advisories. She booked a two-week trip in November to the Gambia, a small country in West Africa where she had been twice before and had made friends. ""With the things I've gone through, I just wanted to get away. Mentally, I needed a break,"" she says. She and her daughter-in-law then vacationed in Jamaica and rode horses along the coast. Returning for Thanksgiving was tough: Friends and family invited her to dinner, but she just wanted to sit alone by her husband's grave. It soothed her to remember the last day they spent together, purchasing tables and chairs for a new event-venue business. They talked about anything and everything while she drove. ""I will always live with the memory of that day,"" she says. She held her husband's funeral repast in the hall they were going to open together. It is the memories that Dr. McCoy says will help her most. Her mom, Alberta Sparks, would always assign foods for family members to bring to the Christmas potluck. Dr. McCoy usually got desserts: poundcake, red velvet cake and key lime cake. She will bake again this year—but she will also make collard greens, a dish her mother always brought. That's because her mom bequeathed her the secret ingredient. ""My collard greens taste just like hers now,"" she says. —Nancy Keates
Enjoying Life in Hawaii, While Planning Christmas Around Poland 
Cooking pierogies online with her grandmother helps graphic designer feel close to family yet work and surf in Honolulu this year Zuzanna Rogatty, 29, Honolulu 
Profession: Graphic designer 
Have any of your traditions changed this year? It isn't possible or practical to prepare a lot of traditional Polish foods this year, Ms. Rogatty says. ""If it's coconut water instead of borscht, haupia instead of kutia or papaya açaí bowl instead of bigos, I'm into it."" Wandering through a shopping mall in Honolulu recently, Zuzanna Rogatty heard the first notes of something familiar but jarring: Christmas music. 
""It feels so weird to see all of the Christmas decorations around the palm trees,"" the 29-year-old graphic designer and recent Hawaii transplant says. 
Paradise can be a strange place to linger during the holiday season when you've always spent the holiday in your native Poland. ""I just feel that I'm kind of skipping Christmas this year,"" Ms. Rogatty says. ""For me, not being with my family or my close friends, it just doesn't feel like Christmas anymore."" 
That isn't to say that she doesn't love her new reality, renting an apartment a five-minute walk from a surfing beach in Waikiki. Skipping winter, for the first time in her life, was part of the plan. Winters in Poland are harsh, frozen stretches, she says, and those in New York, where she lived for the last couple of years, weren't much better. With her boss' blessing, she put her desk, books and winter clothes in storage, packed one suitcase and set off for Hawaii at the end of the summer. 
""I just took a risk. It was my adventure,"" Ms. Rogatty says. 
After a two-week quarantine, she started developing a rhythm to her new life: wake by 5 a.m., work until 1 p.m., spend the afternoons biking, hiking and swimming in the ocean. At 5 p.m., she's on her surfboard. The ritual has become meditative. 
""There's just days that you just paddle out to the ocean and there's no waves. You sit on the board, observe the world, how beautiful it is here. You can see a volcano, a rainbow, beautiful sky,"" she says. She catches the sunset, then heads home. Once a night owl, she's now asleep by 8 p.m., since she has to keep East Coast hours for her job. 
Ms. Rogatty says the pandemic has made her value her family—and staying connected with them—even more than when she was living close by. December finds her preparing to ship a package of Hawaiian goodies—cacao nibs, macadamia nuts, Hawaiian-print shirts—to Poland. She has plans to make pierogies with her grandmother over Zoom on Dec. 23, and then bring the dumplings to a Christmas picnic hosted by new friends. —Rachel Feintzeig Retiree Brings Spirited Flexibility to Locked-Down Holidays on Her Own 
Californian embraces many ways to celebrate even if traditions have changed; 'Go ahead and order a nice takeout dinner' 
Kendra Heath, 69, Windsor, Calif. 
Profession: Retiree 
Do you see a silver lining? ""I have seen and spent time with my sister this year more than any other I can remember. We have never been extremely close but it feels as though we have gotten closer this year, which is nice as we are the only two left of our family."" 
Any holiday advice for other singles? ""Do something special for themselves. Go ahead and order a nice takeout dinner. Decorate if that makes them happy. Get flowers for the house. Do exactly what you want to do."" Kendra Heath plans a long solo drive and lunch alone on the Mendocino coast on Christmas Day. ""I'll treat myself to a cracked crab lunch. If things go right, crab season will be under way by then."" 
The single 69-year-old retiree from Windsor, Calif., adds, ""I will eat outdoors, in my car or just take it home."" The temperature will likely be in the mid-50s and ""I am not a cold-weather person."" 
Ms. Heath will spend the holiday alone for the first time in four years. She normally spends Christmas at her
sister's house, feasting on the turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, green-bean casserole, and carrot soufflé whipped up by her brother-in-law. 
During each holiday season, Ms. Heath is usually creating a mix of occasions celebrating Thanksgiving, Christmas and her Dec. 26 birthday. 
""This year, with me turning 70, I sort of wanted something special,"" she says. ""But with Covid, that will not be happening, especially with the spikes we are seeing . I am now looking at ideas for virtual parties. Maybe I can still think of something."" 
Ms. Heath, a twice-divorced mother of one—she has a son who lives with his family in Boise, Idaho—had originally planned to spend Thanksgiving the way she had for years. Ms. Heath usually organizes what she affectionately calls orphan dinners by gathering groups ranging from three to 11 friends who also may not have family options for the day. She would prepare a turkey, potatoes and a fruit salad and each guest would bring a dish too. Covid canceled that. ""I have only one or two friends that I really trust in that regard,"" she says, laughing. Then seriously, she says, ""I'm just not going to chance it with anyone and I know they won't either."" So she mixed things up and invited her sister and her family for Thanksgiving. With that major holiday already shared with Ms. Heath, her sister and brother-in-law will be in Seattle to spend Christmas with their grandchildren. ""I honestly have no problem being alone for the holiday,"" Ms. Heath says. ""I can sort of play it by ear and do whatever I feel like doing that day."" —Ray A.

232,Safety: Falls Linked to Social Isolation: [Science Desk],"People who lived alone or who had few social contacts were up to 24 percent more likely to have falls than their socially connected peers. 
Living alone or being socially isolated may increase the risk for falls in older people, British researchers report. Their study, in Scientific Reports, included data on 4,013 men and women, most older than 60, who reported they had fallen, and on 9,285 who were hospitalized after a fall. The scientists used well-validated questionnaires to assign each participant a score on a scale of social isolation ranging from zero to six, with six indicating the fewest social contacts. They were also graded on a similar scale to measure how lonely they felt. After adjusting for socioeconomic, health and lifestyle factors, they found that people who lived alone were 18 percent more likely to have reported a fall than those who lived with others, and those who scored six on the social isolation scale were 24 percent more likely to fall than those with a score of zero. Scores on the test of loneliness were not associated with falls after adjusting for social isolation and other variables. 
The risk of falls resulting in hospitalization was 23 percent higher in people living alone and 36 percent higher among those with the least social contact compared with those with the most. 
""The key message is that the elderly socially isolated are at greater risk for falls,"" said the lead author, Feifei Bu, a senior research fellow at University College London. ""We are encouraging people to look after them more closely, help with daily activities, keep in touch, and so on.""",12/22/20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,5
234,Easing senior isolation is often a click or a call away: Nonprofits strive to keep older adults active amid pandemic,"Instead of meeting with friends over lunch, Marv Lofquist now goes online to chat with a half-dozen men who also
have memory loss, taking comfort in sharing similar experiences while safely apart.
""Humans are social beings,"" Lofquist, 77, said from his Golden Valley home -- via Zoom. ""It's important to use the
functionality that I have maintained instead of isolating ...like talking to people.""
The Alzheimer's Association, which organizes dementia support groups, has boosted online services to combat
isolation during the pandemic. Other Minnesota nonprofits that serve seniors are doing the same, shifting senior
center activities online, teaching older adults how to navigate FaceTime and Zoom, and recruiting volunteers to
call seniors for informal chats.
It's all part of a concerted effort to keep seniors active and show that someone cares during a tough winter.
""We all suffer from [loneliness],"" said James Falvey, executive director of Little Brothers-Friends of the Elderly. ""We
want to really break down those barriers.""
Isolation has emerged as a second crisis in the pandemic for people of all ages, but especially for older adults
during the holiday season. Since June, social isolation or ""isolation due to COVID-19 conditions"" has been a factor
in deaths of at least 12 seniors, according to a Star Tribune analysis of death certificate records.
The state has restricted social gatherings of more than 10 people indoors until Jan. 11 due to surging coronavirus
cases, but even without state rules, many older adults would hunker down to avoid the virus, which can be deadlier
for older residents.
So nonprofits like Falvey's are trying to bring new connections and hope. Little Brothers-Friends of the Elderly has
expanded statewide for the first time this year, training volunteers to call and check in with older adults. The
Minneapolis-based organization is also delivering holiday packages to seniors and unveiling a statewide phone
line in 2021 that adults 60 and older can call for an informal chat.
The Jewish Family Service of St. Paul started a similar program with free phone calls from volunteers to seniors in
long-term care facilities. The organization also is delivering holiday gifts and cards to isolated seniors and calls or
sends gifts to Russian-speaking Holocaust survivors.
""Not only are we serving our seniors, but our volunteers really want to do something for someone,"" said Jodi
Saltzman, the nonprofit's community engagement manager. ""It's just nice to have ...a new relationship to connect
with.""
'Difficult being alone'
In Minnetonka, Senior Community Services, which helps older adults continue to live independently, found that
95% of their clients own a computer, tablet or smartphone, but many didn't know how to use apps.
This summer, the nonprofit launched a pilot program to teach clients in the west metro and in Wright County how
to navigate FaceTime, set up Hulu or tap into online grocery delivery services. One woman wanted to access Zoom
for a Thanksgiving celebration while an 85-year-old man wanted to learn how to text on his first cellphone to stay
in touch with friends.
Joe Kaul stopped by Sharon McDonald's home in St. Michael recently, wearing a mask and staying at a safe
distance, to give her a tutorial on Zoom so she could attend meetings at her senior center or connect with friends
and family out of state. It's hard living alone since her husband died, she said, but especially now in the winter
during a pandemic, unable to even mingle with neighbors outside.
""It's difficult being alone at a time like this,"" McDonald, 78, said. ""I just wouldn't have been able to do a lot of things
without this program.""
A 'lifeline' to connect
Senior Community Services has also shifted programs online at its senior centers in the metro and in St. Michael
and is adding iPads to each center for visitors to borrow or play cards on. CEO Deb Taylor said people of all ages
feel more alone during the pandemic, which is likely why the organization has had the number of users double on
its website, CareNextion.org, which helps families coordinate care.
""This really gives people ...a lens into what it might be like for older adults living in isolation and hopefully bringing
into the forefront some compassion,"" she said.
Like so many Americans, Lofquist now spends a lot of time on Zoom, FaceTime and other virtual platforms -- from
his dementia support group to choir practice and the family's Thanksgiving celebration. The retired college
administrator said the virtual socializing keeps his mind active.
""It feels like a lifeline for people with dementia,"" added his wife, Elaine Lofquist.
Farther reach online
Shifting support groups online makes them more accessible for people who live farther away, said Woo Bandel,
who organizes the groups with the Minnesota and North Dakota chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, which has
also moved educational programs online and started a virtual support group for caregivers of loved ones in long-
term care facilities. They'll keep a virtual option post-pandemic.
""It gives people an opportunity to not feel alone,"" she said. ""Everyone in that virtual room can truly empathize with
those challenges.""
In Golden Valley, the Lofquists are preparing for another quiet holiday at home together. No extended family visits,
no dressing up for parties, no dinners out. But the virtual versions are better than nothing, Marv Lofquist said.
""It's a great alternative,"" he added. ""You shouldn't have [a pandemic] without Zoom.""

238,Full Isolation: [Op-Ed],"Eight months into the pandemic, Brendan House, a nursing home in Kalispell, Mont., had not had a single resident test positive for the coronavirus. It was an extraordinary feat, given that 40 percent of the deaths from Covid-19 nationwide had occurred in long-term care facilities. 
For years, Brendan House had received a top five-star rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., the federal agency that oversees nursing homes, and its staff members took pride in looking after the 110 residents. Because the facility was connected to the local hospital, it hadn't faced the shortages in personal protective equipment or lack of testing and expertise that bedeviled other nursing homes during the pandemic. It seemed to be a model of how to survive a plague. 
Then came November. The numbers of those testing positive in the surrounding community went up by a factor of 100 compared with in the summer. At Brendan House, one positive case ""turned into 10, then 50. Before you know it, we had 54 people in our long-term area who were Covid-positive and only three residents who were not positive,"" a certified nursing assistant told me. 
The facility was marked like a disaster zone: red rooms (for full isolation), yellow (recovered) and green (negative). The nursing assistant, who has been in the field for 15 years and asked me not to use her name for fear of harassment, described a cascading sense of doom. Sickness and death on an unmanageable scale. She cried while recalling one resident, an older man who had been in fine health before he contracted the coronavirus and died. ""He was in therapy, he was walking, he had a lot going for him,"" she said. ""One of the things he told me when we went into quarantine was that he was going to pass away without seeing his son again."" I heard a similar account from a licensed practical nurse named Danielle in central Pennsylvania. (She asked that I use only her first name to prevent retaliation at work.) Her nursing home, too, had warded off the coronavirus until the fall. ""Then October hit, and it was a mass disaster. It went from one to five to 10 to 15 patients,"" she said. ""They had no idea how to isolate this."" 
A few weeks in, though it was too late to contain the spread, the home decided to put all Covid-19 patients on the same floor. They were moved into an unfamiliar setting, their belongings whittled down to a few pieces of clothing and mementos thrown in a plastic bag; a new set of masked nurses came in and out of their rooms. Only a handful of residents had cellphones, so Danielle used her own to help residents use FaceTime with family members and friends. 
She somehow managed to avoid getting sick herself, but many co-workers contracted the virus and had to take time off, using up their vacation hours. Only in late October did the nursing home begin to offer a few extra dollars per hour in hazard pay. 
Meanwhile, Danielle's duties were stretched to include the work of an undertaker, with instructions to treat the dead as though they were still contagious. ""They make you sanitize the body and stuff any orifice full of cotton, spray them with disinfectant and put a mask on them and put them in a bag. To me, it hurts to do that. This was your family,"" she said. 
The first coronavirus outbreak in the United States occurred in a nursing home near Seattle, in late February. Since then, the country has endlessly revised its hot spot map. Yet the situation in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities has only gotten worse: More than 120,000 workers and residents have died, and residents are now dying at three times the rate they did in July. 
Long-term care continues to be understaffed, poorly regulated and vulnerable to predation by for-profit conglomerates and private-equity firms. The nursing aides who provide the bulk of bedside assistance still earn poverty wages, and lockdown policies have forced patients into dangerous solitude. 
A few weeks ago, nursing home workers and residents began to receive vaccinations for the coronavirus, but even full immunization will not allay the tragedy that has unfolded in long-term care -- not just the deaths, but also the isolation and neglect. 
Lori Smetanka, the executive director of the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, an advocacy nonprofit, told me stories of nursing home residents who've gone weeks without being showered or having their teeth brushed. Residents with dementia have suffered terribly from a lack of human contact, leading to depression and loss of weight, mobility and speech. 
Sharon Wallace, 62, whose multiple sclerosis landed her in a Rockland County, N.Y., nursing home several years ago, said that an unattended rash recently turned into an open wound, and she described feeling lonely and trapped in quarantine. ""I feel like my health is going downhill,"" she told me. 
When the pandemic is finally history, we'll need to deal with all of this: the staffing shortages, low pay and lack of accountability -- the many ways we have failed residents, family members and staffers. The awful truth is that long-term care was designed to fail years before Covid-19. 
Over the past few decades, the popularity of ""aging in place,"" combined with new medical technologies and longer life spans, has changed the nature of care for seniors and people with disabilities. Residents of the nation's 15,400 C.M.S.-certified nursing homes are much older, sicker and poorer than they used to be. ""Nursing homes are really little hospitals, yet they're not staffed like it. If you asked an I.C.U. nurse to take care of 15 people, she'd laugh at you, but that's essentially what we have,"" Chris Laxton, the executive director of AMDA, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, told me. 
At the same time, many of these caregivers ""are making $12 or $13 an hour,"" Alice Bonner, of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, said. ""They can barely support themselves and their families. Some of them are working in nursing homes during the day, then assisted living in the evening and home health at night."" As a result, workers probably helped spread the virus from facility to facility, home to home. And residents may have done the same. Depending on their condition, it's not uncommon for a senior or a person with disabilities to go from assisted living to a hospital to a nursing home within a few months' time. 
Early on, when the coronavirus was killing mostly older adults, there was a sense of relief that the young might be spared. Nursing home residents were shut off from ordinary life; they were going to die anyway, commentators implied. And the workers who were getting sick -- they weren't health professionals but glorified babysitters with minimum-wage qualifications. Weren't illness and death their lot? 
A week after the outbreak near Seattle (and months after the first cases in China), C.M.S., run by Seema Verma, whose conflicts of interest outnumber her credentials, began to act. But some of the agency's decisions merely amplified existing problems. 
Under President Trump, C.M.S. had already cut monetary fines for facilities with health and safety violations. Now it called off regular inspections in favor of a narrow, superficial infection-control survey. It also allowed for ""temporary nursing assistants"" with little training to fill in for certified aides. 
When Congress allocated $5 billion under the CARES Act to help struggling long-term care facilities, a dozen companies accused of labor violations and Medicare fraud received more than $300 million in no-strings-attached relief. It wasn't until late summer that C.M.S. mandated testing for residents and workers. Nursing home operators have long complained that Medicaid doesn't pay them enough to provide adequate care, but the business is not, apparently, a bad one to be in. Two-thirds of nursing homes are for-profits, and the sector has been swallowed up by corporate chains and investment firms whose involvement correlates to lower staffing and worse care. 
Now the industry is pleading poverty while paying lobbyists to seek protection from lawsuits. In more than half the states, long-term care providers are shielded from liability for Covid-19 claims brought by residents, workers or their families, and legislation that would extend such immunity nationwide is pending. 
Proponents of the protections, like Mark Parkinson, a former governor of Kansas and the president of the American Health Care Association, which represents 14,000 nursing home and other long-term care entities, argue that ""most of these facilities will end up going bankrupt"" without them. 
But if now is not the time, when, and under what conditions, should nursing homes and assisted-living facilities be held accountable for the welfare of their residents and workers? 
Elizabeth Halifax, a registered nurse and expert in elder care at the University of California, San Francisco, pointed out that ""nursing homes have had big increases in funding during Covid, but no real improvements in staffing have resulted."" The core issue, she said, is that ""there are no limits on the levels of funding that nursing homes allocate to administration and profits."" 
Ask anyone in long-term care why the pandemic has been so damaging, and ""staffing"" will be the reply. Sufficient numbers of well-trained nurses and aides have always been the key to managing disease, and during the pandemic, homes with higher staff-to-resident ratios have had fewer positive coronavirus cases and casualties. Such facilities are, however, rare. 
It's hard to hire for a job that involves helping others bathe and eat, dressing wounds, and cleaning and providing emotional support -- for low wages, little paid time off, a short career ladder and unpredictable part-time hours. Factor in the risk of getting sick and dying, and retention, let alone recruitment, becomes far more difficult. In 2020, direct caregiving may have been the most dangerous job in America. 
It's telling that many nursing homes have chosen to hire temporary subcontractors (who are actually paid at higher rates) rather than increase wages and benefits for permanent employees. Hank Drummond, the chief clinical officer of Cross Country Healthcare, a national staffing agency, told me, ""The demand, compared to what it usually was, is four to five times more."" Jane Davis, the administrator of Landmark Care and Rehabilitation in Yakima, Wash, said that she resorted to hiring agency workers after a dozen employees quit out of fear of developing Covid-19. 
Joe Biden is about the age of the average nursing home resident. Over the summer, he announced a $775 billion proposal to provide care for children, seniors and people with disabilities. The plan, though notional at this point, would eliminate the 800,000-person waiting list for long-term care under Medicaid and pay for 150,000 new community health workers for seniors. It could also help transform millions of low-wage, high-turnover, often transient gigs into stable careers. 
But to prevent another disaster on the scale of the coronavirus, the Biden-Harris administration (and state and local regulatory bodies) should go further. 
C.M.S. must ensure that the $264 billion paid by Medicaid and Medicare to long-term-care providers actually goes to caregiving, instead of shiny new buildings or executive pay. It can do so by placing caps on how much money is earmarked for profits and bureaucracy, imposing strict accounting requirements and conducting regular audits. Even Mr. Parkinson, the A.H.C.A. president, acknowledged that any increase in Medicaid funding should come with ""some accountability to make sure it goes to patients."" 
C.M.S. should also regulate assisted-living facilities that serve Medicaid and Medicare patients, just as it does nursing homes. (At present, these facilities are overseen by state agencies, with wide variation.) Then private-equity firms might have less incentive to enter this field, and patients and workers would know, once and for all, whether businesses are telling the truth when they say they're operating on ""a razor-thin margin."" To improve residents' quality of life, the government should mandate that long-term-care facilities have appropriate staffing. We can do this by requiring a minimum amount of nursing time for every resident -- 4.1 hours per day, experts say. A bill to this effect was introduced in Congress in 2019. 
And certified nursing assistants must be paid a living wage -- in most places, $20 or more per hour. A recent study found that such an increase would finance itself by elevating the standard of care. With stable, better-paying jobs, nursing-home staff members could also avoid working in multiple facilities, helping reduce the transmission of the 
coronavirus and other, future viruses. 
In addition, Mr. Biden must reverse Mr. Trump's laissez-faire approach to this sector. Both C.M.S. and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration should be given the resources they need to inspect, investigate and fine providers for health and workplace violations. The incoming administration must also strengthen workers' rights to organize and protest unsafe conditions under the National Labor Relations Act, as it has already promised to do. 
Most important, we must transform the way we think about long-term care -- treating it not as human warehousing or the duty of underpaid women, but as an integral part of our medical system. 
All of these changes are possible -- and modest, really, given the magnitude of the emergency. By 2050, 19 million people will be 85 or older, and many will require help to live with comfort and a modicum of dignity. What we really need, for all Americans, is single-payer health insurance that covers quality long-term care. But short of that, Mr. Biden and Kamala Harris have a chance to make amends for the deadly failures of the current administration. Just before Christmas, I checked in with Danielle, the licensed practical nurse in Pennsylvania. She had a rare day off, which meant a reprieve from her oppressive uniform of N95 respirator, goggles, face shield, gown and shoe coverings. ""Everybody in the facility has it,"" she said. And now patients who had been treated for the virus in the hospital were being discharged straight into her nursing home to quarantine. 
""The stress is ungodly,"" she told me. ""Every day you go there, your family pays for it when you get home."" ""The reason I keep going back is, I like long-term care. I've always liked my people, and they love seeing me. They know when they have me as their nurse, they're going to get the right food and medication, and can get a snack or make a phone call."" 
Yet Danielle, like many workers I interviewed, has thought about quitting. ""There are jobs that offer $45 per hour to do Covid testing,"" she said. As if to nudge her out the door, her nursing home was recently purchased by a large corporation, nullifying the union contract, and management reneged on the promise of holiday bonuses. The facility hadn't yet received its shipment of vaccines, but Danielle, who called herself a ""usually pro-vaccine person,"" told me that she and most of her co-workers weren't planning to get the shot. Scientists agree that the vaccines are safe and well worth the risk, but it's easy to understand Danielle's mistrust. After all the death she's witnessed, she doesn't believe that pharmaceutical companies or the government or her bosses have suddenly come to value caregivers' lives.",1/3/21,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,3
239,"To cope with the isolation of the pandemic, she embraced the natural world. She wasn't alone.","It's April and gorgeous out, but I am too depressed to get out of bed. I feel like I'm stuck in some viscous fluid and the only sensible thing to do is just go back to sleep. I'm occasionally woken up by the sound of my husband on back-to-back conference calls. Is it really necessary to yell? I wonder. But I can't complain, since he's working hard while I'm ... not. 
It's late afternoon when Steve finally notices that I'm still in bed. ""Are you okay?"" he says. ""When did bedpans go out of style?"" I say, avoiding the question. ""I bet if Anthropologie started selling them, they'd be a hit."" 
""You need to get outside,"" Steve says. 
The outdoors is the last place I want to be right now. Just taking the elevator is rife with peril, especially when only half of the people in our building seem to be wearing masks. I live in Navy Yard, a densely populated neighborhood south of Capitol Hill in Washington, and the sidewalks are crowded with people who are constantly wandering into my six feet of airspace. It's stressful trying to calculate dozens of other people's trajectories and intentions. 
I can't help but wonder if Steve just wants me out of the apartment. We've been living and working in the same 720 square feet for more than a month. It's quite a change from our pre-pandemic lives. Steve's job had him trotting the globe for weeks at a time, and I was always out and about - writing from coffee shops and then flitting from museums to concerts to restaurants. 
I decide to take his advice, though, because I do need some exercise. I find my squeaky old bike and set off toward the Mall. Then I remember that I'm trying to avoid people, so I circle the block and head in the opposite direction, away from the crowded center of the city and alongside the Anacostia River, all the way to its headwaters in Bladensburg, Md. 
On my way back home I am feeling better. Getting my heart rate up definitely helps, but even more uplifting is the hopeful spring landscape: lime green fields freckled with wildflowers, trees unfurling new leaves, ducklings splashing in a mud puddle. 
I crest a hill, and something panics in the tall grass. A deer! He's trapped between me and a chain-link fence, and when he leaps forward I instinctively speed up. We race side-by-side down the hill; the fence comes closer to the bike path, pushing the buck toward me. I want so badly to touch him, or, even better, to follow him into a world that makes a lot more sense than mine does right now. 
But the ground flies up at my face, and suddenly I'm beside the path with my bike half on top of me. It appears that I've skidded out on a patch of dry leaves. My pants are torn and my knees are bleeding, but I'm basically fine. The deer is long gone. 
Sitting dazed on the pavement, I wonder what kind of madness has gotten into me. The pandemic and accompanying shutdowns are affecting everyone, of course, and I truly have nothing to complain about when other people have lost jobs or loved ones. But as an extreme extrovert suddenly forced into near-total isolation, I feel like a dried-out husk of my formerly vivacious, gregarious self. Am I so desperate for company that I've taken to chasing down wild animals? 
In fact, I'm about to go through a profound change. As the pandemic drags on, my need to connect with nature intensifies to the point where I don't even want to sleep indoors. I spend entire days in city parks and come home with twigs in my hair, claiming to have learned the language of birds. I become so attached to nature that I barely even recognize myself. 
As it turns out, the stress of 2020 has many of us looking for relief among the leaves. National and state parks, especially those near population centers, are seeing lots of foot traffic: Year-to-date visitorship as of October was up 14 percent at Shenandoah National Park, 16 percent at Amistad National Recreation Area and 55 percent at Catoctin Mountain Park. People also seem to be engaging with nature more deeply than before the pandemic. As of mid-December, iNaturalist, an app that citizen-scientists use to identify wild plants and animals, had seen a 62 percent jump in users and a 60 percent increase in observations in 2020 as compared with 2019. A similar shift happened during the last major pandemic, says historian Terence Young, author of ""Heading Out: A History of American Camping."" Being outdoors was considered (correctly) to be healthier than the indoors, and that seeded a surge of car-based camping. ""In 1918, many people took up car camping because they were afraid of traveling to campgrounds on trains, which was the main way people got to national parks back then,"" Young says. ""Then the popularity of car camping really exploded after the pandemic, in the 1920s. I think we're going to see that happen again, but with RVs this time."" (Indeed, RV shipments to dealers have jumped 4 percent this year and are expected to increase by 19 percent in 2021.) 
After the 1918 flu pandemic, though, so many people visited national parks that it took a noticeable toll on the beauty of America's most stunning landscapes. Young worries that might happen again if maintenance budgets don't keep up. ""I want people to go out to the natural world because then they will want to protect it,"" he says. ""But they need to understand that there is a price."" 
The surge of interest in the outdoors since the pandemic took hold isn't specific to America. One study published in November in the Journal of Forestry Research analyzed Google location-tracking data and found significant increases in park usage worldwide during the pandemic's first wave. 
The recent bump of interest in outdoor hobbies such as gardening and hiking ""could be one of the silver linings of the pandemic,"" says Selin Kesebir, associate professor of organizational behavior at London Business School. ""Even if they don't continue with them after the pandemic, we know that being outdoors is a very good way of coping with the current situation."" 
Research has been piling up since the 1970s on the many salutary effects of spending time in nature. A walk in the park, or even just looking out a window at some trees, decreases blood pressure, stress hormones and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Exposure to natural settings also spurs improvements in mood, cognitive function, and empathy and cooperation. 
How green places work this magic is a bit of a mystery, but, according to a paper published this year in the journal Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, it seems that natural settings give us exactly the right amount of stimulation. A babbling brook, a Creamsicle sunset, the smell of wet ground after rain - these phenomena capture 
our interest, but they don't require the focused attention demanded by most indoor activities, such as doom scrolling or watching ""The Great British Baking Show."" Being in nature seems to give the brain permission to relax and just exist. ""Something about nature helps us to stay more mindful and improves our executive function,"" Kesebir says. 
This certainly fits with my experience. I've always found it relaxing and rejuvenating to be outdoors, but the anxiety and isolation of the pandemic, the uncertainty of civil unrest and, oh, I don't know, the potential crumbling of American democracy have made me crave nature like a drug. 
About a week after chasing the deer, I'm sitting on the ground with my back pressed against the scaly bark of an American elm. I look around to make sure no one's watching, then lie sideways on the dirt, with my ear to the ground. I've been desperate for sensory stimulation since the movie theaters and museums closed, so when a nature book tells me that a wonderland of exotic smells and sounds awaits anyone bold enough to get their head close to the ground, I decide to give it a try. 
The book, ""What the Robin Knows: How Birds Reveal the Secrets of the Natural World,"" by Jon Young, explains that songbirds are the surveillance system of any forest. They work together to keep an eye out for danger, and if you spend a great deal of time just sitting quietly in one spot, you can learn to decipher their calls. I've chosen a wooded city park on the Anacostia called Heritage Island as my ""sit spot,"" but a few days in I'm feeling a little discouraged. I already know the songs of common birds, but I still have no idea what their quiet little chips and chirps could possibly mean. 
White-throated sparrows are foraging under a bush a few yards away. They leap forward with both feet to pull back some leaves and then snatch whatever little seeds or bugs they stir up. With my ears so close to the ground, I can hear their whisper-quiet chirps. They sound a little like the jingle of coins in a jar. 
A pair of cardinals chatter high overhead; they never stop talking to each other, this couple. But then I notice a sudden change in the tone of their conversation: It's gotten louder and more urgent. The sparrows disappear into a tangle of branches and vines, and I sit up just in time to see a golden retriever bounding toward me. A woman appears, grabs the collar of her dog and pulls him back. In the Before Times, I loved petting people's dogs, but now I keep my potentially germy hands to myself. 
""Sorry,"" the woman says. ""I didn't see you there."" 
The woman looks at me appraisingly, trying to figure out if I'm crazy or homeless or what. I'd love to chat with her; small talk used to be one of my favorite pastimes. But she's not wearing a mask, so I want her to go away. I pointedly return to staring at the shrubbery, and she takes the hint and leaves. 
My heart is beating hard - and it's not just because of the close encounter with a potential virus vector. I'm excited because I understood what a cardinal was saying. At least, I got the gist of it: Heads up! Danger! The woods are quiet and still for a while. I hear a two-note song from a robin overhead, and the sparrows drop down from the bushes and resume their scratching. Was that the ""all clear"" signal? I never quite figure it out, but after that day, I always know when a hiker is coming, especially one with an unleashed dog. The birds tell me. As spring turns into summer, I find myself spending more and more time outside. I sit quietly in the woods for hours, sometimes lingering well into the night. It's not just that there's so many interesting things to watch. The woods are the only place where I feel like myself; when I'm home, I'm a nervous wreck. 
Sometime in August, I find that my old sit spot has gotten soggy, so I relocate to a broken boardwalk on the same island. It's late, and the chirping of birds quickly gives way to the chirping of crickets, and the trees become a proscenium for the darkening sky. I feel a tingle in my spine, and I know the bats are here. A few minutes later, they swoop over me, a moonlit snapshot of complicated aerial maneuvers on leathery wings. I feel like I'm being visited by eccentric friends. This feeling of connectedness is exactly what I've needed, ever since all my loved ones were banished to a distant planet called Zoom. 
When the pandemic hit, it was immediately obvious that video conferencing was a poor substitute for human contact, bereft of depth and sensory stimulation. But it wasn't until I started sitting quietly outdoors that I fully realized that physical man-made spaces have many of the same shortfalls. While my apartment is perfectly pleasant, there's nothing much compelling there, while a similar-size patch of woods is brimming with life and surprises. My sit spot is in a state of continual flux: Vines overtake shrubs, mushrooms sprout, the tide goes in and out. I'm treated to an ongoing parade of exotic visitors - butterflies, praying mantises, ospreys, frogs. And the more closely I pay attention, the more I see. Natural places reward close observation, and as soon as you solve one mystery, another one presents itself. Why, I wonder, is that duck swimming in circles? Why are those crows all gathered in the same tree? I find myself constantly making inferences, testing hypotheses and keying in to senses I usually neglect. It's odd, but I feel more alive in natural settings and more human than I do in my human-built home. 
Best of all, the life-or-death struggles of animals distract me from my own petty concerns. One night, I glimpse a red-tailed hawk with something in its talons, and I go home wondering if it was one of the muskrat kits I've been watching grow up. Without really planning to, I wake up before sunrise the next day and bike to my island to stake out the muskrat nest. When the family comes out for the day, I count only three baby muskrats, one less than there used to be. I'm sad for the kit and happy for the hawk - and these emotions fill me up with acceptance and  equanimity. This peaceful feeling is the exact opposite of what happens when I read the newspaper, where nearly every story has me wishing something had gone differently. 
By the fall, I can't bear to be out of sight of trees. I set up a home office on our tiny porch and refuse to come in except to go to sleep. When I'm indoors, I'm like a video game character with a rapidly depleting ""life"" bar. If it gets to ""empty,"" I'll get stuck in my bed again. 
The view from my porch is mostly other people's apartments, so I spend a lot of time lying on my hammock and looking at the sky. The most exciting sky show is when dark thunderheads roll in, but I also enjoy watching the cotton-ball clouds scroll by like a filmstrip. Boring, solid-blue skies are my least favorite - or so I think, until one day in September when I find the sky has turned putty gray. Since I'm not really reading the news, it takes me a while to figure out that what I'm looking at is smoke from the California wildfires. The fact of the fires - that they are worse than ever before - has gotten past my bad-news embargo, due to Steve's habit of watching ""Last Week Tonight With John Oliver."" So when I see a bizarrely hazy sky, I eventually put it together. 
The air quality here in D.C. is fine - the smoke is too high to affect us - so I can't explain why I'm feeling physically sick. I've long known about the slow-motion catastrophe that is climate change, but this is the first time it's felt like a personal assault. Every time I look at the sky, it's as if someone has punched me in the gut. Perhaps this is the downside to having an intimate relationship with nature. 
I'm not the only one making the crucial connection between my health and the planet's health. Alison Greenaway, a scientist at Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research, interviewed 40 New Zealanders in the early months of the pandemic, and many noted that they felt closer to nature during the country's shutdown. ""One person felt a personal sense of loss when trees in her local park were cut down during lockdown,"" Greenaway says. Her participants also drew inspiration from humanity's response to the pandemic, including our ability to change our behavior overnight. ""People talked about slowing down, and how they wished that they could continue to maybe not produce and consume so much,"" Greenaway says. ""They talked about their desire for a circular economy, and perhaps growing their own food and how these are exactly the kinds of things we need to be doing in the future, to save the planet and, by extension, ourselves."" 
If these insights stick, it would be very good news for the environment, but it's just as likely that people will simply return to their old attitudes and habits once this crisis passes, Greenaway says. ""I would certainly hope that as people spend time in nature, they would think to themselves, 'Man, I've really got to preserve this for future generations,' "" she says, ""but I'm not sure that that always happens. During the pandemic one of the things that's been really disturbing me is to see the level of plastic pollution and littering that's just exponentially increased. So, yeah, people might be spending time in nature, but are they making that connection between their own behavior and preserving the natural world?"" 
I've also seen an increase in littering on my island over the course of the pandemic. When I call up Lora Nunn, the vice president of Friends of Kingman and Heritage Islands, to confirm my hunch, she says that she too has noticed more garbage on the islands but adds that this has been accompanied by another, more heartening trend. ""More people have been reaching out, wanting to help out or get involved,"" she tells me. ""We've had to turn people away at our last few garbage cleanups."" 
I feel a sudden wash of embarrassment because I am not one of those people. Out of fear of covid-19 germs, or perhaps just because it's gross, I haven't picked up a scrap of trash all summer. I ask if they need any volunteers. ""We're pretty much done for the season,"" Nunn says. She mentions that she's volunteering with a group called Anacostia Watershed Society. ""They might still need people."" 
They do, in fact, so the next week I ride my bike past the bridge to Heritage Island, up the hill where I chased that deer, and a few more miles to a trash-choked stream called Nash Run. We aren't there to pick up garbage, though; we're tagging and releasing mussels. 
Our leader, Jorge, explains that mussels consume the excess bacteria and algae that's in the water. ""A single mussel can filter a gallon of water an hour,"" he says. In the spring, we will try to find the tagged mussels to see how much they've grown. 
Lora is there, as is a woman named Nancy, and we spend an enjoyable hour sitting in a field, gluing labels on shellfish and gabbing about their kids and my cats (while masked and at a safe distance). I'd been worried about being near other people, because of the virus as well as my increasingly rusty social skills, but my anxiety melts as the joy of making friends takes hold. Our conversation turns to the pandemic, and I tell them how I've gone from being a consummate urbanite to someone who absolutely cannot live without constant access to green space. ""My husband and I are actually looking at moving to Front Royal, so we can have our own little patch of forest,"" I say. ""I'm even trying to learn to drive."" I know that impulse isn't environmentally friendly, but it's like the time I wanted to hug a deer: Loving and protecting nature don't always go hand-in-hand. 
We pull on waders and carefully place the mussels into the cool, clear water. It would be such a pretty little creek if the banks weren't lined with plastic bags and bottles and condom wrappers. ""I should come back with a garbage bag and pick all this stuff up,"" I say. And, a few days later, that's what I do.

241,"CORONAVIRUS IN CALIFORNIA; Easing teens' 'collective trauma' during pandemic; Through the nonprofit City Year, recent college grads help students navigate the fear and isolation.","Correction: Student counselors: In the Jan. 12 California section, an article and accompanying photo captions about a nonprofit organization helping L.A. students handle their fear and isolation during the pandemic identified City Year corps member Alejandrina Arizmendi-Ramirez as Alejandrina Arizmendi-Ruiz. The article also described Mary Helen Immordino-Yang as an assistant professor of education, psychology and neuroscience at USC; she is a professor. 
Sometimes it's karaoke. Sometimes it's multiplayer games like skribbl or Among Us. Whatever it is, middle school student Tiggerina Virgen never skips her after-school program -- even though it means more time on Zoom. During one meeting, Alejandrina Arizmendi-Ruiz, a recent college graduate who runs the sessions, found out that Tiggerina had an F in science. 
She quickly mobilized support for Tiggerina, making sure she submitted missing work and stayed on track. Tiggerina's grade rose to a D. Then a C. 
""I was, like, I'm so proud of you!' "" Arizmendi-Ruiz said. ""I asked her: 'So, what helped you change that grade? What are you planning to do next?' "" 
Arizmendi-Ruiz's intervention at John Liechty Middle School typifies the work of 225 young adults who are embedded in 26 schools throughout Los Angeles County, including Boyle Heights, Inglewood, Pico Union and Watts. 
They're part of City Year, a nonprofit tied to AmeriCorps. Usually corps members serve as mentors and tutors to help students reach graduation. But during the pandemic, they have become a social lifeline for students, many of whom are faltering as they grapple with a sense of despair after months away from their friends. Education experts said the personal, on-the-ground work City Year members provide is an example of the type of extended learning support that is needed to address the growing mental health crisis among students as school closures drag into the 10th month. 
Recent data and studies signal the increasing toll the pandemic is taking on students. Since last spring, the proportion of mental-health-related emergency room visits has increased 31% for children 12 to 17 years old, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show; a survey of 3,300 high school students described a sense of ""collective trauma"" as nearly a third said they are more often feeling unhappy or depressed. Arizmendi-Ruiz, a UC Santa Cruz graduate and the first in her family to go to college, knows firsthand why students need support. 
""Growing up, I was not a student to reach out for help,"" she said. ""It wasn't until I was trying to figure out what to do after high school that I realized I couldn't do it alone."" 
At John Liechty Middle School, students told her that time to socialize is most important to them during the after school sessions. 
""Genuine human interactions are what really matter now,"" said Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, an assistant professor
of education, psychology and neuroscience at USC whose research examines the relationship between emotions and deeper levels of learning. 
The pandemic has introduced a host of burdens to students' lives. Concerns over relatives falling ill, the fear of getting sick or infecting loved ones, even dying, she said, are ""consuming kids' thinking because they're so emotionally salient."" Also, many families are grappling with housing and food insecurity, making it difficult for students to focus on academics. 
Since April, the Los Angeles school district's Student and Family Wellness Hotline has received more than 11,000 calls, mostly from caretakers seeking mental health support for their children or seeking assistance with basic needs. 
Tyrone Howard, a professor at UCLA's School of Education and Information Studies, urges school leaders to develop strategic plans to address students' mental health needs. 
""There are real out-of-school factors that impact students' ability to do well in school,"" Howard said. When students finally get back in the classroom, he added, educators will have to address the social emotional well-being of students. ""We cannot just jump back into learning as usual when kids have endured so much."" :: 
Corps members, who typically earn a biweekly $735 stipend in Los Angeles, said the lack of in-person contact is the biggest obstacle to cultivating meaningful relationships with students. In the past, the kids could readily approach them on campus. They could also sit beside struggling students in class and pull them aside for a chat. Andrea Labb is a University of Massachusetts at Amherst graduate and corps member who works with students at Jefferson High School in South Los Angeles. Last year, she supported a student who suffered from acute anxiety. ""When she got overwhelmed, I would take her out, and we'd just walk around campus for five or 10 minutes,"" Labb said. ""Sometimes she would talk about what was going on. Sometimes we'd talk about Harry Potter. Sometimes we just walked in silence."" Afterward, they would return to class and the student would reengage. Such coping strategies are currently impossible. For Labb and her colleagues, this meant figuring out new ways to reinvent past experiences. To attain a semblance of normality, corps members wear their yellow jackets when they're online with students. Without morning greetings, which involved blasting music and welcoming students on campus, corps members exploit Zoom's chat feature. 
""We greet them all every morning,"" Labb said. ""We send them a message just asking, 'How are you?' or 'How was your weekend?' It's a small way of adding humanity to all this technology."" 
Corps members then take note of the students' responses. If any are routinely silent or say they're not feeling great, they follow up. 
In addition to providing homework help and space for interaction, some corps members help monitor students' mental health -- a task that's become more urgent and difficult with distance learning. 
Faced with the pandemic maelstrom, Principal Adalberto Vega and staff at John Liechty Middle School have made mental health a constant theme at virtual meetings with parents, in which administrators teach them how to spot signs of stress in their children. 
The administrators were also intentional about City Year's role in students' well-being. When developing the after school program, said Vice Principal Eleanor Murray, ""the plan of action was to reach a clear understanding of how the social emotional support would take place, because the rapport has to be developed for students to feel comfortable enough to share their thoughts and feelings."" 
When students share personal challenges, corps members listen closely. Then, if necessary, they connect them with counselors or administrators who can provide them with additional support. 
""To be the person that students turn to if they need to talk is a privilege,"" Labb said. ""It's something I take very seriously."" 
Strengthening students' support network amid the pandemic has proved fruitful. Back in August, Tiggerina's mother, Yesica Ayala, worried about her daughter's transition from elementary school to sixth grade at Liechty. 
Tiggerina has always been a bit shy. When schools closed in March, Ayala struggled to get her out of bed and ready for class. 
But Tiggerina is navigating the school year with success. Her camera stays on when she's in class. She's making new friends and seeks help when she needs it. Science has become one of her favorite courses. Ayala credits the change in her daughter to City Year, which gives her the opportunity to connect with friends or staff members before hunkering down for class. From her bedroom, Ayala often hears her daughter's laugh.

243,Looking for a cure for loneliness? Try the arts: Minnesotans combat the pain of isolation with projects big and small.,"KT Taylor grew up in rural Idaho, gay and lonely, feeling like ""no one like me exists anywhere within a 100-mile radius."" Then Taylor went to college in Virginia, and found a kindred community in Minneapolis. But when the pandemic hit, Taylor (who uses they/them pronouns) suddenly felt isolated. A little like a small-town teenager. 
So they made art. Inspired by gay newsletters of decades past, the 24-year-old put out a call for letters, illustrating seven of them to create a zine: ""Not Alone, Never Was: a Penpal Zine 4 Rural Queers."" 
""Hello, my friend,"" one begins. 
""I wanted to give people the experience of having something arrive in their mailbox,"" Taylor said. ""Something they could read through, feel the pages ... almost this talisman that's a physical piece connecting them across distance."" 
By mail and via Zoom, artists have been reaching out across the distances created by the pandemic, offering a balm for one of its most menacing side effects -- loneliness. 
This fall, Springboard for the Arts put out a call for projects combating social isolation, especially within communities that were at risk of it even before the pandemic. The nonprofit has been funding, in $500 chunks, a huge range of efforts, including hand-delivered art kits, online coloring classes and a parking-lot concert series for seniors. Taylor's zine, too. 
It's part of a broader effort to connect with people, especially seniors, as concerns about COVID keep folks hunkered down at home. Experts say the arts can play a powerful 
role during a time that has highlighted the long-studied mental and physical benefits of participating in the arts. A British study published in November found that people who engaged regularly with the arts during the pandemic -- by writing, reading, crafting or watching performing arts -- reported lower rates of depression and anxiety. About 22% increased their participation in the arts during lockdown, while 16% decreased their engagement, according to the COVID-19 Social Study, a massive effort to track the social and psychological effects of the pandemic. 
""Younger adults were more likely to have increased their arts engagement during lockdown, whereas older adults engaged less,"" the study found. 
'It's not just entertainment' 
While access to the arts decreased as many cultural institutions closed their doors, the pandemic has also opened new pathways, with more theaters, orchestras and museums making plays, concerts and collections available online. 
Children's Theatre Company offers kids classes online. The Minneapolis Institute of Art's family days have gone virtual. Giving Voice Chorus, for people living with Alzheimer's, has been rehearsing via Zoom. ""We now expect everything to be online,"" said Beth Bienvenu, director of accessibility for the National Endowment for the Arts. ""So that's opening up so many more opportunities for people who have difficulty leaving their homes even before the pandemic ... people who, for different reasons, don't want to be out in public or can't be seated for three hours to watch a show."" 
Those opportunities aren't available to folks without access to the internet, she noted. But across the country, artists and organizations are finding creative ways to overcome that barrier, offering phone access to Zoom lessons and mailing printed packets to prisons. 
The Minnesota Conservatory for the Arts in Winona has moved one-on-one lessons to Zoom. It shifted an adaptive dance class online. It beefed up its intergenerational postcard exchanges. 
Inspired by that work, Jamie Schwaba, the conservatory's managing director, launched her own monthlong series of projects, nabbing a Springboard grant for materials. 
She bought supplies for dozens of people to create ""happy notes,"" tucking them into friends' windshields and Little Free Libraries, and to paint rocks, dropping them off in parks and gardens. 
The pandemic has ""given us a whole new perspective on the important role that the arts can play -- and how much we do need the arts during times like these,"" Schwaba said. ""It's not just entertainment."" Before the pandemic, the conservatory, which is part of St. Mary's University, had planned in-person events with the library in Caledonia, a town south of Winona known as the Wild Turkey Capital of Minnesota. Instead, they made the story times, oil pastel classes and postcard workshops virtual. 
From June through December, 4,500 people participated in more than 40 programs. 
""We only have like 2,700 people in Caledonia,"" said Caledonia Public Library director Stephanie Eggert. ""We're just amazed with how it took off."" 
Some seniors don't have internet access or ""just aren't computer-savvy,"" she noted. So she'd put the videos on a jump drive, dropping them off at their homes. She delivered art kits to parents' homes, too, knowing that many were already scrambling with child care. She also drops off bags of books, picking titles she knows her regulars would like. 
""We have quite a few elders in the community who don't do technology,"" Eggert said. ""I didn't want to leave those people out."" 
Residents tell her that the classes, postcard exchanges and art kits have made a huge difference during a difficult time. She told the story of a young boy who, before the virtual event began, wanted to take a minute just to talk. These days, loneliness isn't relegated to the elderly. 
""The kids, they're lonely,"" she said. 
For some, it's survival 
Springboard for the Arts' call focused on higher-risk groups, including people in care facilities, essential workers and families lacking access to broadband. 
Nearly a third of the 89 projects the nonprofit funded were proposed by rural artists and nearly half by artists of color. 
Artists were charged ""with identifying a socially isolated community they had some connection to and imagining what they would do to bring people together, to offer a moment of joy or reflection,"" said Jun-Li Wang, Springboard's associate director for programs. 
Unlike streamed events that anyone, anywhere can access, most of these projects are tailored for a small, specific audience, she noted. 
Springboard funds projects like these partly to demonstrate how artists can help solve complex social questions, such as inequal access to the arts. 
""Yes, artists can, on a small scale, address nursing home residents who are isolated, caregivers who are stressed,"" Wang said. ""But what we're saying is that those artists can ask different questions, so that we come to a day that some of these things just don't happen. ... Artists should be in the mix of solving those huge problems."" A few years back, Ann Lopour, of Rochester, tagged along with a friend to an Elder Network support group for caregivers. 
""I thought she needed help,"" said Lopour, 74, whose husband has Parkinson's disease. ""I found I needed that class as much as she did, maybe more."" 
That class led to others. In the months before the pandemic, Lopour got dinner with friends, visited her children in Arizona and California, volunteered at the local animal shelter and at the jail. A retired nurse, she could see what 
was coming: ""I knew this was going to be a long haul."" 
So early on, she installed and figured out Zoom. When the Elder Network partnered with the Minnesota Conservatory for the Arts offered a virtual class titled ""Intentional Doodling,"" she was ready. She's a quilter, not a drawer, but thought, ""What the heck, I'll try it."" 
The instructor's drawings were intricate, delicate and a little intimidating. But she assured her pupils: It all starts with a single line. Making line after line, dot after dot, Lopour feels her shoulders relax and her mind zone out. ""When you're done,"" Lopour said, ""you feel like you've taken a deep breath."" 
Since that class, a group of doodlers, including a 12-year-old girl and ""a gal from South Dakota,"" has continued to meet weekly via Zoom. 
It's an important ritual for Lopour, who has struggled with clinical depression for five decades. Three years ago, because of complex health issues, doctors recommended she stop taking antidepressants. Since then, she's managed her depression with the help of mindfulness and art courses. 
""So this is survival,"" Lopour said. ""I have to do this creative stuff for survival.""",1/17/21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,4

247,WHY OLDER PEOPLE HAVE A HARDER TIME IN THE PANDEMIC; SENIORS WERE ALREADY IN A LONELINESS EPIDEMIC. HERE'S HOW TO EASE THE ISOLATION FOR YOURSELF OR LOVED ONES,"Elder Americans were already in an epidemic before the pandemic began. 
In 2018, the AARP released a report about the mental and physical effects of social isolation on older Americans, particularly those living in skilled nursing facilities. 
""A lot of people, as they get older, their social circles decrease quite a bit. Family moves away from many of them, and family and friends begin to die,"" said Lori Smetanka, the executive director of the nonprofit advocacy organization National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care. 
Some may have moved to skilled nursing facilities, assisted-living residences or senior living communities in part to make new friends and spend more time around others, sharing meals and organized activities. Now they find themselves even more isolated. As the coronavirus pandemic rages, they're dealing not only with chronic loneliness but also fear of a deadly disease that primarily kills people like them. 
""There's the isolation and then also the dual terror of how this disease has just torn through nursing homes,"" said Manuel Eskildsen, a clinical associate professor at the David Geffen UCLA School of Medicine and a physician who treats older patients. ""I think everybody's scared right now. But it's even scarier to know you're in the absolute most vulnerable group and you can't get away from it."" 
The effects of loneliness are mental and physical. And they can spiral: Feeling lonely and isolated might make you move around less and not eat as frequently or as much as you should, Eskildsen said, which leads to decreased quality of life and physical health, which can make you depressed, which leads to moving around and eating less. Part of the problem is the ways many of us have adjusted to the new normal might not be available to older people. Figuring out video calls can be tricky, and they're difficult to participate in if eyesight or hearing isn't great. Many facilities have enacted strict rules about visitors, so even if someone is offering a masked outdoor visit, they might not be allowed to do it. 
Even the brief socialization of a trip to the grocery store or walk in the park is not possible for people with limited mobility or who don't drive anymore, or whose facilities won't allow them to leave and come back. Inside the facilities, group meals and activities are canceled, and staff interaction is limited to food and medication delivered in full PPE. 
Older adults in skilled nursing and assisted living facilities have been trapped in solitary confinement in their rooms as coronavirus has swept through the places they live. Smetanka called it a ""triple whammy"" of trauma: the fear of getting sick and dying, the isolation that comes from protecting yourself from getting sick and dying, and the high likelihood that your friends, relatives and the people who live and work in your facility are getting sick and dying around you. 
""When you think of the number of people who have died in long-term care facilities, residents are losing whole support systems in there; the residents, the one they would sit in the dining hall with or see in activities, a lot of those people have died. And so it really has been very traumatic, the sense of loss, the sense of grief that they're experiencing along with the loneliness and isolation,"" Smetanka said. And the impact is grim: ""There are, even beyond COVID, a lot of excess deaths [in nursing homes] that would not have occurred"" if the pandemic hadn't happened. 
Even for those not in skilled nursing facilities, it's a scary time for older people, said Kimberly Lewis. She's the executive director of the I Did Something Good Today Foundation, a nonprofit that creates programs to help older people combat social isolation and other problems. The foundation runs the chat and crisis line GoldenTALK, which seniors anywhere in America can call to ask for help or to find a friendly person for a conversation. GoldenTALK is available from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Pacific time at (888) 604-6533. 
She said a lot of volunteers have been hearing from callers that they're afraid to go out and do the basic, normal things they didn't think twice about doing a year ago. 
""You've got people who are used to going out and getting things on their own, having their freedom and independence. Now they can't,"" Lewis said. 
For older people and for everyone else, help is on the way. The vaccine rollout is taking place, albeit haltingly: L.A. County has authorized vaccinations for people 65 and older. But it will likely be at least a couple more months before that group is all vaccinated and longer before their family members are able to get the vaccine and safely visit. 
In the meantime, here's what you can do to ease the effects of loneliness and isolation if you're an older person or someone who loves one.

ADVICE AND IDEAS FOR OLDER PEOPLE DEALING WITH LONELINESS 
Don't be afraid to ask for help. ""Nobody wants to be a burden,"" Eskildsen said. But you must be willing to overcome that reluctance to reach out and ask for help if you need it, whether it's telling family you'd like to hear from them more often or telling the staff at your facility that you need help or reaching out to your long-term ombudsman to get access to services such as counseling. 
Make a call. The Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health has a program for adults 60 and older called GENESIS (Geriatric Evaluation Networks Encompassing Services Intervention Support Programs). The program can connect you with individual and family counseling, medication services, and education and support. Phone number: (213) 351-7284. 
L.A. County also runs a warmline you can call to talk to someone about whatever is on your mind: (855) 952-9276 for English, (888) 448-4055 for Spanish. Available 5 to 10 p.m. Pacific time Monday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. 
GoldenTALK, the program run by Lewis' foundation, is available to help find resources and programs or just to talk with someone: (888) 604-6533, available from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Pacific time. 
If you're experiencing a serious mental health crisis, the Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24 hours a day at (800) 273-8255.

HOW FAMILY AND FRIENDS CAN HELP 
Reach out. It really can be as simple as a phone call, Lewis said. ""That voice means everything to them. ... They want to know that they're not forgotten and that they're still loved."" 
If they can't speak on the phone, send emails or arrange video chats (keep reading for more on how to make that easier). Smetanka said she knew of one person whose father was in a long-term care facility who sent the staff a 15- or 30-second greeting to play for him every day. Send cards, letters and drawings so they know you're thinking of them. 
PDF GENERATED BY PROQUEST.COM Page 2 of 4
Set them up with something fun to do. Puzzles, large-print books, music, knitting, crafts -- ""send them those things and then talk to them about those things,"" Smetanka said. Whatever their favorite social activities were before the pandemic, help them find ways to do them virtually. That can mean sending a link to virtual religious services, setting them up with music streaming or introducing them to online bridge or other games and activities. Lewis said she was working on a pilot program to get more Amazon Alexa-enabled devices to older people to make it easier to make phone calls, create grocery lists, play music and do other things for people who aren't computer savvy. Tools like an Amazon Echo Show or Facebook Portal will enable them to make a video call just using their voice. 
Provide a tablet loaded with video chatting apps. A lot of care facilities launched pilot programs last spring to get residents connected to Zoom and similar programs, Eskildsen said, but the problem is that staff is stretched so thin that it's tough to carve out time to walk someone through a tutorial on video chatting. Make it as easy as possible for everyone by sending a tablet with the apps installed and an account logged in so all the recipient has to do is click a button to connect. 
Talk to the staff. Resources may be stretched thin in skilled nursing facilities now. But if your loved one is having a hard time with mental health, make sure the staff is aware, Eskildsen said. 
""The squeaky wheel does get the grease,"" he said. ""If they have that person who's constantly on their case to provide the opportunities for human interaction and decreasing loneliness ... they'll probably be more attentive to that person."" 
Work on ways to visit. Stay in touch with the facility to learn about changes to visitation policy and to ask about ideas for connecting. Could you do an outdoor masked and distanced visit? Can you arrange to have your loved one situated by a big window where you can stand outside and wave? An abbreviated visit is better than no visit. Volunteer. Get involved and help people in your community stay connected. GoldenTALK is looking for volunteers, Lewis said, and it can be done virtually. You can learn more about that and more in our database of volunteer opportunities (lat.ms/volunteer) in Southern California. There is plenty that can be done without leaving the house.",2/6/21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,8
249,You Should Talk to Strangers—Even During the Pandemic; Social distancing and isolation mean we're missing out on serendipitous exchanges with strangers. Here's why—and how—we should work to make them happen.,"Aurora Flores hadn't gone out much during the pandemic. But recently she forced herself to take a walk in New York's Central Park to clear her mind and seek solace in the sound of birds and a waterfall. As she was strolling down the path, another woman approached, wearing a mask. Letting out a loud yelp, the woman flung a handful of birdseed in the air. 
Suddenly, a flurry of titmice, cardinals, blue jays and robins appeared, as Ms. Flores stood there amazed. The stranger offered her some seeds, and Ms. Flores poured some on her gloved hand, holding it out in front of her. One by one, the birds began to land on her fingers. 
""I was elated. I felt blessed,"" says Ms. Flores, 67, a writer. ""She saw me beaming, and I could tell she smiled. Then she went on her way."" Now, Ms. Flores says she is motivated to go outside almost every day. Strangers can soothe and support us when no one else is around, or boost our mood with a smile or a laugh. They can distract us from the chatter in our own head and help expand our perspective. They can make us feel connected and remind us we are not alone. 
Yet we're missing out on many of these serendipitous moments during the pandemic. Social distancing, working from home and the disruption of normal activities have reduced our opportunities for casual exchanges with people we don't know, or with whom we have only loose ties. Yet, if we work at it, it's possible to generate those moments even now—and psychologists say we should. 
They suggest we grab every opportunity—even while we're keeping a distance. Join a group, especially online. (It can be less scary.) Say something positive—don't just complain. Don't take it personally if someone doesn't want to engage. 
Gillian Sandstrom, a psychologist and senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Essex, in Colchester, England, who studies interactions with strangers, has found that people's moods improve after a conversation with someone they don't know , such as a barista or a museum guide. She's also discovered that people are happier on days when they have more of these types of interactions. 
In yet-to-be-published research conducted last spring after the pandemic started, Dr. Sandstrom found that 64 people who were matched with a stranger for a Zoom call happily chatted for an average of 40 minutes—much longer than the 14 minutes they'd predicted. Participants also reported enjoying the conversation more than they'd expected to, and that the things they'd worried about—such as an awkwardness starting or maintaining the conversation—didn't happen. They said they had an increased sense of trust in other people after the conversation. And they said they felt significantly less lonely and less socially isolated. 
""Having a single conversation with a stranger during this tough time can make us feel better in the world,"" says Dr. Sandstrom. 
And yet in this pandemic year, as we've learned to avoid and even fear getting close to other people, we've lost not just our interactions with strangers but also with the casual acquaintances that researchers call ""weak ties."" Research conducted during the pandemic by Yale sociologist Marissa King and colleagues, published in January in the journal Socius, found that people's social networks contracted 16% during the pandemic—with most of the shrinkage being casual relationships, such as the person you're used to seeing in the gym or the colleague you chat with in the elevator but don't know well. 
The study also found that people who interact more with strangers are less lonely—and that it doesn't matter how long those interactions are, just how many of them people have. Participants reported that even emailing with strangers helped. This may be because of something called the ""stranger on the train"" effect: People sometimes share more with someone they don't know, which fosters connection. ""They feel anonymous, which allows them to be more honest,"" says Dr. King, who is a professor of organizational behavior and author of ""Social Chemistry: Decoding the Patterns of Human Connection."" 
In reporting this column, I talked to many people who said they'd had meaningful interactions recently with strangers in grocery stores, while talking to customer service representatives on the phone, and while walking their dogs. Adrienne Renner, 72, a high school computer teacher in San Jose, Calif., says the messages she received from strangers in Facebook groups for people with pets buoyed her after her beloved cat, Sunny, died in November. Meghan Finn, 42, a marketing executive in Mount Kisco, N.Y., says a conversation with another woman while the two were waiting to get MRIs for cancer screenings helped calm her fear of being claustrophobic in the machine. Steve Miksis, 70, a retired forensic accountant in Santa Rosa, Calif., says he's gotten in the habit of asking people he encounters: ""How are you doing today?"" ""I have found it gives pause and folks offer a bit—sometimes more—of personal details,"" he says. 
San Diego travel blogger James Hills, 44, worried about in-person conversations with neighbors, so he solicited their phone numbers instead—and found he's made new friends. Los Angeles artist Cassidy Cole, 28, began volunteering with a charity that delivers groceries and medicine to elderly people; now she's begun having regular chats with a woman she helps out. ""It didn't matter that we were strangers because the collective of what we were going through instantly created a bond of shared experience,"" she says. 
Michael Hassard, 50, a quality assurance engineer from Lake Charles, La., was buoyed by a grocery store cashier. He felt overwhelmed as he stood in line one recent evening—exhausted after a long day at work, worried about other customers who stood too close or weren't wearing masks correctly, overwhelmed by the stress of a pandemic year. 
The cashier was silent as she rang his items up. But when she placed his bag on the conveyor belt for him to pick up, she held onto it. ""Have a blessed day,"" she said. Then, as he fought back tears, she stepped out from around the counter. ""We're going to be all right,"" he says she told him. ""We'll get through this together."" Mr. Hassard felt his mood lift. ""I had this immense feeling that I was not alone—that people still care about each other whether they know each other or not,"" he says. 
How to Connect with Strangers During the Pandemic 
Take every opportunity. Customer service representatives. Neighbors walking their dogs. Delivery people. Someone in line at the pharmacy. ""Recognize that you can feel replenished from unlikely sources,"" says Noreena Hertz, an economist and author of ""The Lonely Century: How to Restore Human Connection in a World That's Pulling Apart."" 
Volunteer. Plenty of nonprofits are taking volunteers while maintaining safety precautions. And it gives you a sense of purpose, which psychologists know improves mental health. It connects you to others, which fights loneliness. And you help someone who needs the support. People who help others are happier and live longer, says Dr. Hertz. ""It's a win-win,"" she says. 
Recycle strangers. Your old boss. A childhood friend. A distant cousin. Reach out to someone you used to know well but who seems like a stranger now. 
Don't be a downer. A misery-fest won't make for a satisfying, or nourishing, interaction, so focus on something other than how tough things are right now. Aim for this goal: Both you and the other person feel uplifted after the chat. 
Use humor. Research shows that laughter, rather than the length of a conversation, is a better predictor of how enjoyable an interaction is, says Marissa King, a professor of organizational behavior at Yale and author of ""Social Chemistry: Decoding the Patterns of Human Connection."" 
Be respectful. Keep your physical distance if you are in person. Keep your mask on. You can even say: ""Don't worry, I won't come too close."" This may help people let down the extra wariness they have about strangers these days. Use nonverbal cues. Yes, people can tell if you're smiling behind your mask. You can also nod hello. Wave. Give a thumbs-up. Research shows that even when people just make eye contact with someone else they feel better, says Gillian Sandstrom, a psychologist and senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Essex, in Colchester, England, who studies interactions with strangers.",2/16/21,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1
253,"Inoculated but still on lockdown in care homes; With vaccination rates up, many are desperate to ease crushing isolation in nursing facilities","Melissa Traub hasn't hugged her 92-year-old mom since March. Like countless others locked out of a family member's nursing home because of COVID-19, she has spent nearly a year listening helplessly on the phone as her aging mom struggles to comprehend her isolation. 
""I have to hear her crying when she's having an anxiety attack, asking, 'Why can't I just come live with you?' "" Traub said. ""She's incontinent. She's in a diaper. I would have to move to a bigger place and hire live-in help."" But Traub's mom is now fully vaccinated, as are most of the residents in her Reseda nursing home. Traub has had her first injection, and her second is scheduled in the coming days. So why can't she go give her mom a hug? Because regulators haven't yet loosened strict rules that impede most visitation. 
As vaccination rates climb rapidly in U.S. nursing homes and the number of new coronavirus infections plummets, doctors, residents and family members have begun pushing to ease the crushing isolation that descended on the facilities last spring. But it's not as simple as just opening the doors and hoping for the best. What about the residents and staffers who refuse to get the shots? Can you segregate nursing homes based on vaccination status, creating two very distinct classes within the same building -- one allowed to hug their grandkids, eat together and play bingo, the other left alone and isolated indefinitely? 
Complicating the equation is the fact that many of the residents and staffers hesitating to take the vaccine are people of color, many of whom are less likely to trust the assurances of a healthcare system that has not historically worked for their benefit. 
As regulators begin to grapple with the science and ethics of reopening, despondent residents and their families are left waiting. 
""It just sucks,"" Traub said. ""Hopefully, it'll all be over soon and she'll be alive when it is. But there's always the horrible possibility that she won't make it that long, we won't ever see her again."" 
When COVID-19 began its deadly march through nursing homes last spring -- it has killed more than 160,000 residents and staff members nationwide -- the only way for the beleaguered facilities to fight the disease was to lock down, cutting off their fragile inhabitants from families and friends. But those early days stretched into weeks, and the weeks into months. In March, it will have been a full year. 
And though the coronavirus is a swift and obvious killer, the crushing isolation created by the lockdowns has taken a more subtle, but still devastating, toll. Depression, always a concern in nursing homes, is on the rise, according to caregivers. Many residents have lost weight because they've simply stopped eating. ""Failure to thrive"" -- a term more commonly associated with undernourished infants -- is increasingly applied to elderly residents in long-term care facilities, say doctors who work in them. 
That's why, as more and more homes complete their two-dose vaccination regimens, geriatricians and advocates for the elderly are pushing to reopen to visitors as soon as possible. ""More nursing home residents have been vaccinated than the rest of the community,"" said Molly Davies, who serves as an ombudsman for long-term care residents and their families in Los Angeles County. ""At some point, a nursing home is going to be the place to be."" 
But it's not easy or automatic to take that step. Though the vaccine appears to do an excellent job preventing serious illness and death, it's still unclear whether a vaccinated person can become infected and transmit the virus to others. And despite the carnage wrought by COVID-19 in nursing homes, there are still plenty of people in them who are reluctant to get the injections. 
""I think the government's nervous about making decisions at the federal level and that filters down to the state level, but the residents, the families and the caregivers have had enough,"" said Dr. Michael Wasserman, past president of the California Assn. of Long Term Care Medicine, which represents doctors, nurses and others working in long-term care facilities. 
In the early days of the pandemic, when family members begged to be allowed to visit, nursing homes had to turn them away because their individual rights were far outweighed by the risk to everyone else in the facility. ""Now, we're quickly approaching a point where, if you're not vaccinated in a nursing home, the primary risk is to yourself,"" Wasserman said. 
The California Department of Public Health is ""in the process of evaluating potential adjustments to visitation policies in nursing homes while also remaining focused on ensuring all nursing home staff and residents have the opportunity to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19,"" spokeswoman Kate Folmar wrote in an email to The Times. This month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 78% of residents who have been offered a vaccine took it, but only 38% of staff members did. 
Current state guidelines allow visitors in residents' rooms where community spread is low, but so far only a handful of rural California counties qualify. State officials say several more could reach the threshold next week. In dire circumstances, such as imminent death, family members have also been allowed ""compassionate care"" visits in full mask and gowns. 
Outdoor visits -- with no touching, mandatory masks and six feet of separation required at all times -- have been permitted statewide since the summer. But many homes have limited space and staff to supervise such visits, making them hard to schedule at the best of times and subject to cancellation when a facility experiences an outbreak, according to family members. 
And they're no substitute for normal visits. 
The last time Melody Taylor Stark held her 84-year-old husband, Bill, was March 13, just before the lockdowns. They kept in touch the best they could electronically, but the technology was unfamiliar and glitchy. Bill missed two telemedicine appointments with doctors outside his nursing home because the iPad used for such visits was locked and the employee who knew the password wasn't at work, Stark said. 
When state health officials began allowing limited outdoor visitation, she thought for sure she'd get to see him soon. Instead, she got a ""constant flow of pushback"" from the administrators of the Arcadia home, who seemed nervous about opening up without explicit permission from the corporate owners of the facility and the county health department. 
Eventually they got a few outdoor visits, but she knew things were bad when her previously upbeat, optimistic husband ""started crying and saying this is no way to live."" 
He died in November. She never got to hold him again. 
Nancy Klein's 53-year-old son has been in long-term care facilities for five years, since a massive brain hemorrhage left him unable to move, talk or feed himself. Phone calls and FaceTime, the lifelines for so many during the pandemic, are not options for him. 
Though there have been some kind employees at the string of Los Angeles and Riverside County facilities he has lived in -- she didn't want to name the current one for fear of upsetting administrators and making visitation even harder -- not everybody is as caring as she would be. Her son is big and hard to move, so she worries nursing assistants will ""bounce his head off the headboard"" while trying to change him. 
The nurses also test the water temperature with gloved hands before they bathe him, instead of with the soft spot in the crook of an elbow, as she does. ""They don't know if it's too hot.... It's just like washing a car to them,"" Klein said. 
Klein, 79, has had her first injection and expects the second shot in early March. Her son still has antibodies from a recent bout with COVID-19, but she will allow him to be vaccinated as soon as possible. Before the pandemic, Klein said, she was with her son almost seven hours a day. She said it's awful to imagine what goes through his mind now without her there. ""He must really think I deserted him,"" Klein said. Still, not everybody is sure it's safe to open to visitors yet. 
Dr. Swati Gaur is a geriatrician for two nursing homes in rural Georgia, north of Atlanta. Although some data suggest that vaccination also reduces a person's ability to catch and transmit the virus, ""I can't take that to the bank,"" Gaur said. 
""I have seen what it looks like when the facility goes down,"" Gaur said, describing the grief and chaos of an outbreak. ""I don't know if I'm prepared to relive that. I don't know that's a loss anyone has an appetite for."" Instead, she said, she plans to introduce communal dining slowly, with about 12 residents at a time in a room designed to seat 50. That way, if there's an outbreak, it can be limited. 
""If the first thing that I do is allow visitation, then we are talking about an unvaccinated person walking the halls, touching patients,"" Gaur said. ""We create a potential network for disease transmission."" Complicating matters is how few people in her conservative, Republican region are willing to wear masks, let alone get vaccinated, Gaur said. 
""I think people take it as a sign of disloyalty to our previous president if they wear a mask,"" Gaur said. ""That might be why I am so reluctant about bringing families into the nursing home."" 
Another strategy proposed for dealing with residents and staffers who decline vaccinations is to isolate them in a separate part of the building -- de facto segregation. 
But many of the residents and staff members hesitating to take the vaccine are people of color, creating the disturbing prospect of homes segregated along racial lines. 
""One of my residents who refused is an African American man in his 70s, who simply 'doesn't believe in it,' "" an Indiana geriatrician wrote in response to a California Assn. of Long Term Care Medicine survey of healthcare professionals on reopening. 
The resident, who recently endured a second below-the-knee amputation due to diabetes, is mentally competent and capable of understanding the issues and making his own choices, the doctor wrote. Staffers talked to him and his family, but they have not been able to change his mind. 
""Is he seriously not going be allowed to play bingo?"" the doctor asked her colleagues. 
In an interview, the doctor, who asked not to be identified to protect her patients' privacy, agreed that the primary risk for residents who refused to get vaccinated is to themselves. She's not planning to segregate them because of their decision. 
""Any notion that you are going to have a handful of people kept away from the rest of population, not allowed to dine, not allowed to socialize, not allowed to visit, is not OK,"" the doctor said. 
Pam Dransfeldt said nursing homes should require people who don't want the vaccine to sign a waiver and let everyone else get back to their normal lives. 
Dransfeldt hadn't seen her 90-year-old father, Jack Spencer, since his Camarillo nursing home had an outbreak in November and stopped allowing outdoor visits. They could still communicate by phone, but it wasn't easy. ""I have definitely seen a decrease in his memory with all the isolation. Also, he's a loner. And when a loner is desperate for company, you know it's bad,"" Dransfeldt said. 
Spencer had his first vaccine injection and is expected to receive his second next week. Like many California nursing homes, Spencer's allowed infrequent outdoor visits before the dizzying surge in cases in November, but they were a poor substitute, Dransfeldt said. They couldn't touch and the masks muffled their voices, which made it particularly hard for him to hear. ""You're kind of yelling across this table,"" Dransfeldt said. On top of that, her dad has hay fever, which gives him a runny nose, so he'd take his mask off and use it as a tissue. ""I was always saying, 'Dad, you can't do that, we'll get in trouble!' "" 
The staff did tolerate her bringing a small dog that would sneak across the table to get cuddled by her father. 
She saw him for the first time in months on Sunday. It was another outdoor visit. In a Facebook post she wrote: ""Dad came out and went right for the sun. I asked where he was going and he said, 'I haven't seen this for a while.' He took in the sun and the birds singing.""",2/20/21,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,6
257,I confess: I've enjoyed the solitude of this pandemic year,"Our last trip out of our home state of Illinois was a year ago to northwest Arkansas, where my wife and I met four dear friends from Tennessee. On that day we were just learning about COVID-19, but not taking it too seriously. The rather radical idea of masking up had not occurred to us as we imbibed and ate our way through the weekend.  What a difference 12 months, more than 500,000 tragic deaths and, finally, an engaged president makes. Whatever your politics are, how can you not be impressed by President Joe Biden's compassion. Biden is so adept at consoling, drawing on his own experience of unthinkable tragedies in his own life. 
""I know all too well -- I know what it's like to not be there when it happens,"" he said two weeks ago to mark the grim occasion of a half-million lives lost to the pandemic. ""I know what it's like when you are there, holding their hands. There's a look in your eye, and they slip away. That black hole in your chest, you feel like you're being sucked into it. The survivor's remorse. The anger. The questions of faith in your soul."" 
Biden's kindness and decency are an inspiring quality of humanness that we so badly need at this crucial moment, when we are so divided and, I might add, so lost. Let's hope it trickles down to all of us. Yet, as comforting as the president's words are, and as hopeful as the vaccine rollout is, along with the downward trend of infections and deaths, the idea of returning to normal, or pre-pandemic days, seems to me, well, surprisingly unsettling. 
What causes me anxiety is, in fact, that very reentry into American public life. For most of the past year, with the exception of necessary grocery shopping (always fully masked, of course), my wonderful wife and I have avoided crowds. Restaurants are a no-go. Friends and relatives have been relegated to texts, emails and one Zoom call. Forget travel. 
There is some social contact I miss, such as my annual visit to my daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren out West, and to my father and his wife in New Jersey. But the rubbing up against strangers in coffee shops, buses and planes? Nope. 
Given my preferred solitary nature, the last year has been, well, kind of sweet. I confess, I like the new normal. Biden promises, ""This nation will smile again. This nation will know sunny days again. This nation will know joy again."" 
Who could not want that? The deaths of so many fellow Americans, and 2 million others souls on this planet we all share, is beyond my intellectual or emotional comprehension. Every other day for the past year, I have dutifully been writing down in my journal the cumulative number of cases and deaths for the world, the nation and my state as a way to stay engaged in the pandemic, to keep from becoming numb to the sheer statistics. I force myself to watch the individual tributes on cable news and read about as many people who have succumbed as I can because, as Biden said, ""The people we lost were extraordinary."" And they were. My family is lucky. So far, knock on wood, we have not lost anyone to the pandemic. But to say I have not felt joy or had sunny days or smiled in the last 12 months would be a lie. A special kind of pandemic closeness has grown between my wife and me. I cannot speak for her, but more than ever, I value her love and devotion. And, because we are around each other more than we have ever been in our marriage, I can observe more closely all the ways she has always made my life -- and ours -- safe, loving and, yes, joyous. Even during the pandemic. 
Call it co-dependency if you like. With good reason, co-dependency can be a negative quality in a relationship, but how else do you construct the long-term bond between two people; a bond that can only be broken by death? The pandemic has truly been a test of that union for all couples, and if one has been alone during this confusing period, I can only imagine how stressful the past year has been. 
I admit the idea of reemerging out of this cozy cocoon back into the contact world of face-to-face, shoulder rubbing and germ-spreading community is not without trepidation. 
Compared with the millions of grieving people at home and abroad, my complaint is indeed insignificant. Yet, I believe even during this grim period that one can hold two thoughts simultaneously: prayers for the fallen and a necessary celebration of life. Despite Biden's promise, this nation will probably never fully return to pre-pandemic normalcy, but that does not mean we should not overlook those unexpected gifts that this odd time has bestowed upon us.",3/12/21,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,only benefits,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,neither,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0
263,"After Suicide of Loved Ones, Toll of Long Isolation Is Felt: [Foreign Desk]","The psychological toll on young people of months in isolation and great global suffering is becoming more clear after successive lockdowns. 
LONDON -- Sunny, driven and with a new engineering master's degree in hand, Joshua Morgan was hopeful he could find a job despite the pandemic, move out of his mother's house and begin his life. But as lockdowns in Britain dragged on and no job emerged, the young man grew cynical and self-conscious, his sister Yasmin said. Mr. Morgan felt he could not get a public-facing job, like working at a grocery store, because his mother, Joanna, had open-heart surgery last year, and Mr. Morgan was ""exceptionally careful"" about her health. He and his mother contracted the coronavirus in January, forcing them to quarantine in their small London apartment for over two weeks. Concerned by things he was saying, friends raised the alarm and referred him to mental health services. 
But days before the end of his quarantine last month, Mr. Morgan, 25, took his own life. ""He just sounded so deflated,"" his sister said of their last conversation, adding that he said he felt imprisoned and longed to go outside. Suicides are challenging to link to specific reasons, but Mr. Morgan's sudden death has left his sister with a feeling that is hard to shake. ""The cost of the pandemic was my brother's life,"" she said. ""It's not just people dying in a hospital -- it's people dying inside."" 
More than 2.7 million people have died from the coronavirus -- and at least 126,000 in Britain alone. Those numbers are a tangible count of the pandemic's cost. But as more people are vaccinated, and communities open up, there is a tally that experts say is harder to track: the psychological toll of months of isolation and global suffering, which for some has proved fatal. 
There are some signs indicating a widespread mental health crisis. Japan saw a spike in suicide among women last year, and in Europe mental health experts have reported a rise in the number of young people expressing suicidal thoughts. In the United States, many emergency rooms have faced surges in admissions of young children and teenagers with mental health issues. 
Mental health experts say prolonged symptoms of depression and anxiety may prompt risky behaviors that lead to self-harm, accidents, or even death, especially among young people. 
Some intellectuals, like the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari, have asked the authorities to weigh the risks of depression if they impose new virus restrictions. And public health officials in some areas that have seen a surge of adolescent suicides have pushed for schools to reopen, although researchers say it is too early to conclusively link restrictions to suicide rates. 
In Europe, with the crippled economy and the aftermath of the restrictions, the psychological fallout of the pandemic could unfold for months, or even years, public health officials say, with young people among the most affected. 
But bereaved families of young people who have died during the pandemic are haunted by questions over whether lockdowns -- which not only shut stores and restaurants but required people to stay home for months -- played a role. They are calling for more resources for mental health and suicide prevention. 
""Mental health has become a buzzword during the pandemic, and we need to keep it that way,"" said Annie Arkwright, whose 19-year-old daughter, Lily, died by suicide in western England in October. ""So many of us have never been taught the skills to help ourselves or help others."" 
While people may have felt a sense of togetherness during the first lockdowns, that feeling began to wear thin for some as it became clear that restrictions were hitting disadvantaged groups, including many young people, harder. ""If you are a young person, you are looking for hope,"" said Dr. Rory O'Connor, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Glasgow who specializes in the study of suicide. ""But the job market is going to be constrained, and opportunities to build your life are going to be slimmer."" 
As winter approached, mental health experts began to see more teenagers in emergency rooms and psychiatry wards and warned of a rise in drug use, gambling or self-harm. A June CDC survey found that younger adults, along with ethnic minorities and essential workers, experienced increased substance use and suicidal ideation. ""Imagine a young person in a small room, who takes their course online and has limited social life due to restrictions,"" said Fabrice Jollant, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Paris. ""They may be tempted to consume more drugs or drink more alcohol, and may have less physical activity, all of which can contribute to symptoms of depression, anxiety and poor sleep."" 
For Pepijn Remmers, such temptations had tragic consequences. 
Pepijn, 14, greeted lockdown restrictions last spring with positive energy. An adventurous and sociable teenager, he picked up piano playing and would slip under the fence of the local soccer pitch on the outskirts of Amsterdam in the afternoons to play with his best friend, Thijs. 
But as the pandemic dragged on, Pepijn struggled to focus and online classes became too ""booooring,"" he told his parents. New restrictions in the fall stopped the soccer. 
He began to take drugs in October, according to his father, Gaston Remmers, and his exercising routine waned in December. As his sleep patterns began to change, his parents took him to a therapist. 
""We would ask him if he was depressed, and he would say, 'Depressed? I don't know what depressed is, I don't think I am. I feel bored, but I don't feel depressed,""' Mr. Remmers said. 
Then one cold January night, Pepijn left the house. He was found the following day in a tent, where he had taken drugs and lit a barbecue to keep himself warm. Mr. Remmers said his son's death was caused by a combination of carbon monoxide poisoning and drugs. 
""With the pandemic, the things that spiced his life, that made it worth going to school, were gone,"" he added. As Pepijn's death made headlines in the Netherlands, a lawmaker asked if lockdown had killed him. It's not as simple as that, Mr. Remmers said. 
But the pandemic, he added, ""provided a context in which things become possible, and which may have otherwise not happened."" 
After a series of lockdowns in Britain last year, one suicide hotline for young people, Papyrus, saw its calls increase by 25 percent, in line with an increase of about 20 percent each year. 
It is unclear, the organization says, whether this is a sign of more people experiencing more suicidal thoughts or symptoms of mental health issues, or if people now feel more comfortable reaching out for help. Lily Arkwright confided in her friend and housemate Matty Bengtsson. A 19-year-old history student at Cardiff University, Lily was self-confident, outgoing and charismatic in public, her friends and family said, but as she went back to school in September, she began to struggle with the effects of lockdown. 
She also became more withdrawn, Mr. Bengtsson said. 
One evening in October, as Mr. Bengtsson and Ms. Arkwright were getting ready to see some friends, she grew upset and called her mother to say that she was coming home, Mr. Bengtsson said. 
Ms. Arkwright took her own life there, a day after the birthday of her brother, one of her closest confidants. ""Lockdown put Lily in physical and emotional situations she would never have in normal times,"" said Lily's mother, Annie. 
Ms. Arkwright said she hoped that growing concerns about young people's mental health during the pandemic would prompt more of them to share their struggles and seek help. 
""It's OK for a young child to fall over and let their parents know that their knee hurts,"" Ms. Arkwright said. ""This same attitude needs to be extended to mental health."" 
But though stigma around discussing mental health has lessened, society, too, needs to normalize talking about suicide, said Ged Flynn, chief executive of Papyrus, adding that the more comfortable people were with the subject, ""the less we need help lines like us."" 
People should be praised for adapting and finding resilience during these difficult times, Mr. Flynn said. ""Even the need to reach out to a help-line shows resilience,"" he said, adding that considering the circumstances, many people were doing ""really well."" 
For Mr. Morgan's friends, the loss of a man they called confident and kind has given them a resolve. ""Josh always said: One day he's going to make it,"" said his friend Sandy Caulee, 25. ""At least we will -- for him."" Yasmin Morgan, left, is mourning the sudden death of her brother. Joshua Morgan, right with his sister and mother, Joanna, took his own life last month during a quarantine period. ""It's not just people dying in a hospital -- it's people dying inside,"" Ms. Morgan said.

265,"For children, isolation can linger: Some kids who have fallen off the 'coronavirus cliff' need adult support","As children return to classrooms and playgrounds, and maybe soon to summer camp, we must not forget that many are still feeling the effects of the social isolation they experienced when school went virtual last year. Learning is still remote for many kids, who continue to be cut off from treasured spaces that nurture positive, developing relationships, caring about others, thinking critically and avoiding negative behaviors. Even though the physical settings might be restored, many children continue to feel an undermined sense of security. Some will be resilient and bounce back. Others will need extra support from parents and adults in their community. 
Mental health workers are seeing young people in their second decade of life who are anxious and depressed. These include both kids who were struggling with their mental health before the pandemic and those who were stellar students with rich social lives who seem to have fallen off the coronavirus cliff. 
The unforeseen loss of routine is especially impactful on young folks like these for whom connecting with peers is so integral to their daily life experience. Now, and since the onset of the pandemic, it's as if the adolescent ecosystem has suddenly been deprived of oxygen and light.    
For far too many young people, this is a painful time when an essential aspect of their lives has been suddenly threatened, resulting in lost connections, isolation and longing. This is a lonely time in which the grief they experience is unacknowledged and unsupported by any social ritual, a demoralizing reality that may lead to days and nights of anxiety, desperation and, for some, deep depression and dark thoughts about whether life is worth living even one more day.     
Although this may be a time to draw closer to one's family, the notion of increasing togetherness with parents at the precise time in one's life that a young person is striving to become more independent can create an existential crisis. Parental support should include encouraging social connection outside the family, either virtually or in safe face-to-face settings. This does not suggest pushing away one's child, but rather empathizing with the healthy need for some separation and peer connection. Groups of peers can create the sparks necessary to ignite the warm fires of intimacy that will help see many a young person through this public health disaster.     Adults need to understand the uncertainty and shakiness that kids might be feeling. Reinforce to them that you are there for them, that we all went through a very difficult time and there will be more tough times ahead in life, but that you will always stand by their side.    
What we know is that young people who feel connected are less likely to engage in high-risk behaviors such as self-harm, violence, early sexual activity or suicidal actions.

267,"Pandemic Spreads Isolation, and Nations Try to Soften the Sounds of Silence; Coronavirus-era social isolation prompts Japan to name a loneliness minister","TOKYO—A year ago when Japan was under a pandemic state of emergency , Seiji Saejima called his ex-wife for the first time since they divorced a few years earlier. He said she told him she was about to remarry and asked him not to call again. 
It was an unwelcome reminder of the isolation he was feeling. 
""I did not have many friends to contact even before,"" said the 34-year-old, who works at a city government office near Tokyo. Then the pandemic forced reductions in activities that kept him connected, like going to singles' mixers. 
""The coronavirus has made me realize I'm lonely,"" he said. 
Recent data suggest many more people are having the same experience, and that is changing the thinking of some governments. 
Japan recently named a loneliness and isolation minister, following the U.K.'s example from three years ago. Diana Barran, who now holds the U.K. loneliness minister post, said Covid-19 was an opportunity to destigmatize the issue. 
""In some ways it has been a much easier argument to make during the pandemic,"" said Baroness Barran. ""Everyone knows what it feels like."" 
A 22-year-old college student, Koki Ozora, sparked Japan's initiative after seeing a rise in messages to a chat site he started. People wrote of being exhausted from taking care of their children, losing their jobs and having suicidal thoughts. 
It reminded Mr. Ozora of his own childhood, when he moved a lot after his parents broke up and he often skipped school. A high-school teacher helped him get out of the dark tunnel by listening to him, he said. ""The teacher was a miracle for me,"" Mr. Ozora said. ""We need to create a system that anyone in trouble could access."" 
The U.K. named a minister after recognizing the impact of isolation on people's health and its economy. One study linked deficiencies in social relationships to a 29% increase in heart disease. Another estimated that a chronically lonely person could cost the government, on average, the equivalent of an extra $16,600 over 15 years, owing to higher medical and other costs. 
""The magnitude of effect of social connection on mortality risk is comparable, and in many cases, exceeds that of other well-accepted risk factors, including smoking up to 15 cigarettes per day, obesity and air pollution,"" said Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a Brigham Young University professor of psychology and neuroscience, in 2017 U.S. Senate testimony. 
In an interview, Prof. Holt-Lunstad said a certain amount of loneliness is normal—just like thirst or hunger—but it becomes problematic when it is chronic. 
In Japan, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has expressed concern about a rise in suicides among women, especially younger women. Last year, 20,919 people took their own lives in Japan, up by 750 people from a year earlier and the first year-over-year increase in a decade. 
That mirrors data from other nations. A survey conducted in October by Harvard researchers found that the pandemic has made more Americans feel lonely, affecting young adults and mothers in particular. In the U.K., a government survey released earlier this year found more than a quarter of British people said they were often or always lonely. 
During pandemic times, ""it's all the more necessary for all of society to extend a supporting hand"" to people feeling isolation, said Prime Minister Suga at a February meeting he called to hear from specialists in the area, including Mr. Ozora, the college student. 
While the rise of women taking their own lives has gained particular notice recently, Mr. Ozora said helping men reach out for help remained important. Men account for 70% of suicides in Japan, with a similar gender ratio globally. 
Junko Okamoto, who wrote a 2018 book titled ""The Loneliest People in the World: Japan's Middle-Aged Men,"" said solitude could be a lifestyle choice—""something aesthetic""—but men often confuse solitude with unwanted loneliness. 
""I think men are bad at expressing their emotions in words,"" she said. To get men connected with others, she said, activities that go beyond talking opportunities are important. 
Kazuhisa Arakawa, an author who has written about what he calls the solo society, said it is important to build connections in a society where more people live alone, but he questioned whether governments could do much about it. In a blog post, he called the new Japanese loneliness post ""nothing more than a show"" and predicted the official would have no more success than recent ministers in charge of raising Japan's birthrate. Births have fallen sharply in the past two years. 
Still, the minister and 31 staff members are working to compile an antiloneliness plan by May. For his part, Mr. Ozora is trying to expand his chat site, called ""A Place for You,"" with more volunteer staffers overseas who could work from midnight to 8 a.m. Japan time, when data show many suicides take place. 
Mr. Saejima, the city worker who has been feeling isolated, said he had heard about hotlines for people going through trouble during the pandemic but didn't plan to call one. 
""There are people who are in a much worse situation than I am,"" he said. 
He said identifying the issue helped him to get started on addressing it. He has returned to his gym and started cooking classes, where he hopes to find a new partner. And he is thinking of switching jobs from his current work of collecting taxes, which he said he finds dull.

270,"Loneliness, Anxiety and Loss: the Covid Pandemic's Terrible Toll on Kids; A year of school shutdowns and family trauma leads to social isolation, stress and mental-health issues","When Victoria Vial's Miami middle school shut down last spring and her classes went online, it felt like the beginning of an adventure. ""I was in my pajamas, sitting in my comfy chair,"" the 13-year-old recalled. ""I was texting my friends during class."" 
Then she received her academic progress report. An A and B student before the pandemic, she was failing three classes. The academic slide left her mother, Carola Mengolini, in tears. She insisted her daughter create to-do lists and moved the girl's workspace into the guest bedroom to pull up her grades. 
Over the summer, Victoria's tennis and theater camps were canceled. Her family postponed a planned trip to Argentina to visit her extended family. 
She formed a pandemic pod with five close friends, but the girls bickered. Subcliques formed, and Victoria and her best friend found themselves excluded. The pod fell apart. 
The return of in-person schooling last fall brought some relief, but with some of her classmates still at home, teachers had to shift their attention between in-person kids and those online, leaving students feeling disorganized and behind. 
The biggest blow came in December, when Victoria's 78-year-old grandfather died of Covid-19. Her mother flew to Argentina for six weeks to help her grandmother. Her father, grief-stricken and withdrawn, had little energy to cook or clean. Christmas came and went without the usual celebratory meals and piles of presents. ""It was super, super hard,"" says Victoria. ""I didn't know how to feel. All of the people I look up to, they are all, like, breaking down."" 
She grew anxious about going to school—afraid she would catch the virus and spread it to her parents. Some classmates didn't believe Covid was real, she said, and some wore their masks down below their chins or dangled them from their ears. Students talked and laughed in clumps, without social distancing. Her grandfather's death loomed large. ""They don't understand how quick it all can just change everyone's lives,"" she says. She turned to social media for solace and to stave off boredom. She gave herself makeovers and posted the results on TikTok. She cut her bangs, then added a pink streak to her hair. She added four new ear piercings with a safety pin. She shaved part of her head. 
As the months piled up, she found it hard to stay motivated to do her schoolwork. Her grades have started falling again. ""Every day is the exact same,"" she says. ""You kind of feel like, what's the point?"" 
Multiple blows 
Rarely have America's children suffered so many blows, and all at once, as during the pandemic's lost year. The crisis has hit children on multiple fronts. Many have experienced social isolation during lockdowns, family stress, a breakdown of routine and anxiety about the virus. School closures, remote teaching and learning interruptions have set back many at school . Some parents have had job and income losses, creating financial instability—and exacerbating parental stress. Thousands of children have lost a parent or grandparent to the disease. 
It is unusual to have so many challenges at once, and for so long. As vaccinations rise and restrictions are lifted, the looming question for this generation is: What will the long-term effects of the lost year be? That question will take years to answer. But there are clues in what we know from previous disasters and emerging research on the pandemic. Psychologists and researchers say that the more major traumas and stressful situations a child experiences, the deeper the impact will be. Children with pre-existing problems such as anxiety and depression or learning disabilities likely face greater challenges. And children living in poverty may have an especially difficult time. 
Harvard University researchers who have been following 224 children ages 7 to 15 found that about two-thirds of them had clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the same number had behavioral problems such as hyperactivity and inattention, between November 2020 and January 2021. That is a huge jump from the 30% with anxiety and depression symptoms and the 20% with behavioral problems before the pandemic. Symptoms were more common in children who had experiences such as having a family member hospitalized or dying from Covid, or a parent losing a job. 
The biggest driver of child well-being during Covid is how parents are functioning, according to a survey of nearly 500 parents with children ages 8 to 17, conducted by Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. ""There's more family conflict because of the pandemic. That is leading to stress, acting out, increased suicidal thoughts in the kids,"" says David Axelson, chief of psychiatry at Nationwide Children's. Dr. Axelson says visits to his hospital's psychiatric crisis department, for emergencies including suicidal thoughts, aggression and psychosis, were up 14% this fall and winter from a year earlier. 
Particularly delicate are the years from 8 to 14. The years around puberty are ones of greater neuroplasticity, when the brain is particularly sensitive to external events and learning experiences. It is when children begin to form their identities and start to separate from their parents. It is also when mental-health issues such as depression and eating disorders can emerge. 
""This is a pivotal time,"" says Ronald E. Dahl, director of the Institute of Human Development at the University of California, Berkeley. ""The capacity for high-intensity emotional learning is enhanced. You're thinking for yourself and developing certain kinds of proclivities and mind-sets."" 
Both positive and negative experiences, particularly social ones, land harder. And they start to shape children's trajectories. Children who struggle with schoolwork and don't get positive feedback may start to feel that school is ""not you,"" says Dr. Dahl. They may stop trying academically, which only reinforces that perception. ""You start constraining your pathways, beginning to actively select these paths and avoiding other ones,"" he says. The good news is that in children this age, troubling trajectories can be relatively easily reversed with positive experiences and by supporting kids through challenges, says Dr. Dahl. These kids also are generally more receptive to guidance from caring adults compared with older adolescents. Psychologists and pediatricians say the majority of children will likely bounce back from the pandemic's challenges, but some might struggle for years. Academic woes 
For much of the academic year, many students were stuck at home with remote instruction. Evidence is mounting their learning suffered. 
In the fall of 2020, math performance among third- to eighth-graders was 5 to 10 percentile points lower than it was in the fall of 2019 , according to a report by the Brookings Institution. An analysis by McKinsey &Co. estimates that Covid-related learning losses among kindergarten to 12th-grade students will reduce their lifetime earnings by between $61,000 and $82,000 . And those numbers assumed that students would largely be learning in person by January 2021. 
Until this school year, 10-year-old Jonathan Giden and his brother Marcus, 12, were A and B students. During the months that South Bend, Ind.'s schools were solely online, their grades plummeted. Since Jonathan and Marcus's parents usually can't work at home, the brothers were often alone during the day. The Wi-Fi could be spotty. Jonathan sometimes didn't understand assignments. He would ask Marcus for help, pulling the older boy away from his own studies.  
Jonathan Giden, left, and his brother, Marcus, saw their grades decline when schooling was strictly online.
Jonathan Giden, left, and his brother, Marcus, saw their grades decline when schooling was strictly online. 
The lure of videogames, YouTube and television often won out over schoolwork. ""When I see new things, I like to try it out, and when that new thing is fun, I just like to stay on it and I forget what I'm supposed to be doing,"" Jonathan says. 
The boys' grades rebounded somewhat after their local Boys &Girls Club reopened and the brothers began going there during the school day. The center's employees helped them keep track of their assignments and troubleshoot technology problems. Now that South Bend public schools are doing a hybrid of in-person and remote instruction, Marcus is in school two days a week and Jonathan is in school four. 
Their mother, LaToya Giden, worries that her sons' struggles with remote learning will have serious long-term consequences. ""What skills are they lacking now? How low did their reading go? How low did their math go?"" asks Ms. Giden, 42, a social worker. 
Jonathan, who is in fourth grade, is slated to take a crucial test this fall, the results of which will largely determine whether he will land a spot at the high-performing public middle school where Marcus is now. Next year, Marcus, who is in seventh grade, will be applying to high school. The school Ms. Giden and her husband, Marcus Giden Sr., want him to attend requires excellent grades. 
Ms. Giden sees these hoped-for schools as critical to her sons' futures, steppingstones that will lead to good colleges and successful careers. She worries that the academic setbacks caused by school closures will hurt her boys' chances of getting in. 
Stress factors 
Psychologists and pediatricians say they have seen a rise in parental abuse and neglect, substance abuse, mental illness and divorce during the pandemic. Past research has shown that exposure to a high number of such issues—what researchers call Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs—can cause changes in how children's bodies respond to stress, which can damage the developing brain and immune system. Exposure is associated with an increased risk of a host of health issues, including depression, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and substance abuse.

How has the pandemic affected the children in your life? Share your story. Join the conversation below. ""We see intimate-partner violence increasing, mental health deteriorating among adults, increasing substance dependence. All of those means increasing ACEs for the kids,"" says Nadine Burke Harris, a pediatrician and surgeon general of California. 
Scientists have found that children with post-traumatic stress symptoms tied to these experiences have changes in brain regions including the amygdala, which is involved in processing fear and emotion; the hippocampus, which is involved in memory; and the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functioning. Such brain changes, if ""not attended to, are going to lead to emotional, cognitive, academic issues later in life,"" says Victor G. Carrion, director of the Early Life Stress and Resilience Program at Stanford University. ""If a parent is emotionally unavailable or in distress themselves, they will be less effective parents,"" says Arwa Nasir, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. 
For 9-year-old Nelle Thin Elk, the pandemic has brought a torrent of tragedy. Last summer, her mother, Ivette Shupla, was laid off from her job in Phoenix. Nelle's father, who lost his job before the pandemic, began drinking heavily, Ms. Shupla says, and started physically abusing her. In September, he killed himself. ""I've talked with her about death,"" says Ms. Shupla. ""She knows that I get sad. She knows how I grieve."" After her father's funeral, the third-grader stopped logging onto her remote classes. ""After my dad passed away, I was too sad to stay on my Zoom,"" Nelle says. 
In December, Ms. Shupla and her daughter, who are Native American, moved from Phoenix to the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where Ms. Shupla was offered a job at a nonprofit—and where she has family who could house them while they looked for a place of their own. 
Not long after the move, Covid swept through the family. Nelle and her mother had mild symptoms. Nelle's great grandfather died from the virus. So did Ms. Shupla's aunt and cousin. Ms. Shupla said Nelle and her older brother, who is 11, have been coping with all the loss by leaning on one another, and that her daughter still finds comfort in favorite activities such as drawing. 
The pandemic has fueled poverty and difficulties affording food and housing, which are associated with negative outcomes, including poor school performance and obesity. In March 2020, 38% of families skipped meals or didn't have enough money to buy nutritious food , according to a nationwide survey conducted by researchers at the University of Arkansas. In 2019, 10.5% of households couldn't buy enough food or were unsure if they would be able to do so at some point during the year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Mental toll 
In a June 2020 survey of 1,011 U.S. parents published in the journal Pediatrics, 14% said their children's behavioral health had worsened since March . About 23% of elementary school students in Hubei province in China had symptoms of depression and 19% had anxiety symptoms after more than a month of home confinement last year during the region's coronavirus outbreak, according to a survey of 1,784 children published in April 2020 in JAMA Pediatrics. 
And while fewer children are being seen in hospital emergency rooms during the pandemic, a greater share of visits are for mental-health reasons . Between mid-March and mid-October 2020, the number of mental-health related ER visits per 100,000 total visits rose from the year-earlier period by 24% for 5- to 11-year-olds and by 31% for 12- to 17-year-olds, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those increases are on top of the already rising incidences of anxiety, depression and suicide among children and teens before the pandemic. 
A fourth of parents of children attending school remotely said their kids' mental or emotional health worsened , compared with 16% whose kids were attending in person only, according to a CDC survey of more than 1,200 parents with children ages 5 to 12, conducted in October and November 2020. 
Mary Alvord, a psychologist in Chevy Chase, Md., says she is seeing two main issues in her practice: anxiety about schoolwork and sadness over not being able to see friends. 
Doctors say they also are seeing more children with eating disorders. The Center of Excellence in Eating and Weight Disorders at Mount Sinai Health System in New York has received about 105 calls a week over the past year, up from about 30 before the pandemic. The majority were from families with children ages 8 to 14, when disorders like anorexia often emerge, says Tom Hildebrandt, the center's chief. 
Some children are restricting what they eat and losing weight in an attempt to deal with the stress and uncertainty of the pandemic, Dr. Hildebrandt says. Others are bingeing because of ""lack of stimulation or boredom,"" he says. Michaela Voss, medical director of the eating disorders center at Children's Mercy in Kansas City, says hospital admissions for children with eating disorders have risen substantially during the pandemic. With many schools shut down and organized sports canceled, some children felt ""there was nothing else to do but exercise and stare at their bodies in mirrors,"" Dr. Voss says. 
Julie Balaban, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire, says she is seeing more children come to the emergency room with dangerously low heart rates or fainting because they are eating so little. 
The children most at risk for mental-health problems are those who have a history of them, says Rebecca Rialon Berry, a clinical associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Health in New York. Children who have an existing condition, such as anxiety or depression, are at risk for worsening symptoms. Miranda Souki, 13, saw a therapist for school-related anxiety and sleep problems three years ago. She had been doing well since then, until the pandemic. The eighth-grader in South Miami, Fla., became terrified of contracting Covid and passing it to her parents and grandparents. ""I don't want it to be my fault"" if they get sick, she says. Miranda tried to avoid any news of Covid and would beg to skip Zoom calls with friends and family because she knew the subject would come up. 
On Mother's Day, the family gathered for the first time since the state's lockdown eased for a celebration at Miranda's grandparents house—a Covid-safe meetup outside, socially distanced and with masks. Miranda had a panic attack. 
""Boom. It was this flooding somewhere near my heart, lungs, rib cage,"" she recalls. ""It was very much, 'I don't want to be here.' "" She started therapy again in June, which she says helped her cope with anxiety. Miranda has been attending school full-time in person since the fall. She has created an elaborate safety regimen. She wears two masks and a face shield and carries a bottle of Lysol, hand sanitizer and a pack of wipes to clean her hands and everything she touches. She hangs back after classes and waits for the hallways to empty out before she dashes to her next subject. Still, the worries come—and they are worse at night. ""I'll be lying awake, and I see images of my day,"" she explains. ""That my friend handed me something and I put hand sanitizer on it. But did I wash my arm? It might have gotten on your arm, and you rubbed your arm on your bed, and now your bed has Covid."" 
In studies on the aftermaths of other disasters—hurricanes, fires, the 9/11 terrorist attacks—from 30% to half of children have some initial negative reaction, including symptoms of anxiety, depression and overall distress, but bounce back. Another one-third are just fine from the start. 
The remaining 15% to 30% have persistent problems. They have physical symptoms like headaches and fatigue, as well as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. They struggle in school and might have long term learning and memory issues. Children who have pre-existing mental-health conditions, who have additional stresses such as poverty or abuse, or have the most direct exposure to the disaster—seeing a tree fall on their home, for example—are most at risk for such long-term problems. 
Scientists say they expect the pandemic to cause deeper and more chronic suffering for more children than most natural disasters. ""What makes the pandemic different is how long it has been going on and how many people are affected,"" says Betty S. Lai, an assistant professor of counseling psychology at Boston College. Social anxieties 
After the pandemic wanes, many children, especially those who are socially anxious or have learning disabilities, may face a bumpy re-entry period trying to catch up in school and dust off dormant social skills. ""As expectations increase for them being out in the world, I expect to see a group of kids that really struggles with it,"" says Jill Ehrenreich-May, a professor of psychology at the University of Miami. 
Mihika Deshmukh, 13, says she feels that ""it's been a lot harder to make friends and talk to new people."" The eighth-grader in Pleasanton, Calif., has been attending school remotely since March 2020. During the entire pandemic school year, she has met up with a friend in person just once. 
She and her friends had been connecting via FaceTime and Zoom regularly, but in recent months those calls have dwindled. ""I feel like a lot of us drifted apart,"" she says. ""It has set in that I'm alone."" 
She feels sad and lonely at times. When she does connect with friends online now, Mihika says, they prefer to share their Spotify playlists and listen to music or do their homework silently rather than talk about their problems. ""Even if you're not talking, it feels like you're with someone,"" she says. 
Emerging research is identifying strategies that may help children be more resilient in the face of the pandemic. The study in progress at Harvard of children and teens has found that those who had structured routines, got more exercise and had less screen time had fewer behavior problems and fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression . ""Routine and structure is really important for helping kids regulate their emotions and respond to all the other chaos that's around,"" says Katie A. McLaughlin, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard who is leading the study. 
Children 12 and younger who had at least some in-person time with peers —in a Covid-pod, for example—also did better. The same wasn't true for teens, however. 
Psychologists recommend that parents help their children find activities that give them a sense of purpose and help them set related goals—whether that be writing a graphic novel or learning to bake bread. Helping others can boost mood, as can adequate sleep. 
For 12-year-old Cole Barker of Chillicothe, Ohio, the pandemic has meant a canceled Little League season and no 4- H summer camp. His parents tested positive for Covid-19 in December. ""I was kind of scared."" he says. ""My dad was in the basement. I was scared that he wouldn't be able to come out of the basement."" His parents both recovered, though his mother had lingering fatigue for months. 
What kept Cole going, says his father, Jamie, was the routine of feeding, brushing and walking the two pigs, Tex and Nancy, that Cole raised for 4-H. ""I was just thinking I've got to keep doing what I love,"" Cole says. Victoria, the Miami middle-schooler, also can point to some high points during her otherwise tough year. Last summer, she and her friends created an arts-and-crafts camp for some younger children in their neighborhood. They named it ""Camp Quaranteam"" and earned $3,000. 
Another escape has been listening to her favorite songs by artists like Drake, Kanye West and Post Malone. She snuggles with her kitten, George, a former stray her parents allowed her to keep because they thought a pet would help. 
She thinks about all the other kids in the world who are living through this time, too. It helps her feel less alone. And Victoria has big plans for when the pandemic ends. 
""I want to go to a concert with my friends so badly,"" she says. ""I see me and my friends yelling the lyrics at each other and screaming the artist's name and just jumping up and down.""

Loneliness, Anxiety and Loss: the Covid Pandemic's Terrible Toll on Kids

271,"Introvert, extrovert: Who are you now?: Social distancing and isolation have taxed extroverts and introverts, but for different reasons. Has your personality changed permanently?","Special to the Star Tribune 
Before the pandemic, Kari Willey embraced an uncommonly wide range of activities. 
A season-ticket holder for the Minnesota Orchestra, she went for gambling weekends at Wisconsin casinos and made a habit of attending the Minnesota State Fair, which she called her ""obsession, my heaven on Earth,"" every day of its 12-day run. 
""The one thing they [the activities] all have in common is that I do this stuff with other people."" But since March 2020, the health care consultant hasn't been out much. The only people she's seen -- clients, co workers, friends -- have been via computer screen. Other than her wife, a therapist who also works remotely from their St. Paul home, Willey has been isolated. 
Much to her surprise, it hasn't been half-bad. 
""I always defined myself as a total extrovert, but now I wonder if I will want to leave my house,"" she said. ""We've been cut off, but there's comfort in not being around anyone but the person I live with. When I even think about going even to someplace like Costco, I feel anxiety."" 
After a year of isolating, Willey wonders if her personality is ""recalibrating."" 
Whether you're extroverted (defined as naturally outgoing, talkative and seeking the energy of others) or introverted (more emotionally reserved and preferring to recharge by being alone), the pandemic has likely changed how you interact. It may also have you reexamining the way you identify yourself. Being outgoing or reserved is at the core of personality. 
""It's the foundation of what we understand about people,"" said John Kammeyer-Mueller, professor of industrial relations at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. 
Carl Jung, the founder of analytic psychology, first described introverts and extroverts in 1921. Even as Jung developed this theory, the influential Swiss psychiatrist noted that few people can be defined as one type or the other. Psychologists and academics today agree. 
""The reality is that there's a continuum,"" said Kammeyer-Mueller. ""Most people sit somewhere close to the middle; they are somewhat introverted or extroverted. There's some evidence there's a genetic component to this; it's how people are hard-wired."" 
Kammeyer-Mueller, who's studied the personality types for years, suspects that many people are finding that they've moved up or down on the introversion/extroversion continuum because of the pandemic. Happily isolated 
Chuck Olsen quips that he's gone from introvert to being a mountain hermit. Last fall, Olsen and his wife moved from northeast Minneapolis to the North Shore. 
""As a lifelong introvert, I was well-suited for the [pandemic] isolation when this all started,"" said Olsen, 49. ""Our long-term plan was always to move someplace rural. We thought we'd do it when we retired, but COVID accelerated that for us."" 
The owner of a virtual reality technology company, Olsen was thrilled to close his office and shift from connecting with potential clients at trade shows to making sales calls online. 
""Now I don't have to stand in front of a table with a banner. Putting myself out there like that is very taxing and draining for me. I do better when I'm one-on-one,"" he said. 
An accomplished nature photographer, Olsen relishes his solitary hikes in the wilderness near his new home on the edge of the Superior National Forest. He's using Instagram to share his pictures of Northern Lights and ice caves and to connect with a community of other North Shore photographers. He expects to meet them in person someday, but he's in no hurry. 
""More people lived on our block in Minneapolis than are within miles of where we live now,"" he said. ""I see more owls than people on my excursions. For better or worse, I've become more introverted."" Needing to reach out 
In forums and on social media postings, many extroverts have expressed their sometimes intense thirst for physical companionship, even the presence of strangers. 
""Extroverts get a charge out of large and frequent group interactions. They need to find strategies to cope when they're not around that external stimuli,"" Kammeyer-Mueller said. ""Even when they're working by themselves, they crave that stimulation. That would drive an introvert to distraction."" 
It may have been easier for introverts to accept the isolating, social distancing and social downsizing caused by COVID-19. But that doesn't mean they've had an easy time of it. 
Carlson School Prof. Connie Wanberg has heard a note of caution from the introverts she's interviewed for an ongoing study. 
While introverts may not have reacted negatively to having less interaction with others, some said they ""feel like 'it's good for me to put myself out there, and I don't get that opportunity now,' "" she said in an e-mail. That's why Wanberg recommends that individuals who are highly introverted ""make sure they are keeping up their connections."" 
New or old normal 
For her part, Willey wonders if the change she's noticed in herself is permanent. She's curious if she will seek out the large-group activities she's always favored once they can be safely staged again. 
""Once we are all vaccinated and the masks are off, I wonder if I will change from the new normal back to the old normal."" 
Kammeyer-Mueller suspects the changes wrought by the pandemic aren't permanent. 
""I'm speaking outside the data, but my sense is that permanent personality change is pretty rare. We are all adaptable,"" he said. ""People may alter their habits, but it's probably a temporary fluctuation."" And that means if the State Fair gets the green light, Willey will likely walk through the gates on opening day. ""I feel like I'm a dried out raisin,"" she said. ""Will I plump back up? I hope so.""",4/10/21,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,4,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,5
272,What Covid-19 Taught Us About the High Cost of Isolation; Let's take the lessons of the past year and apply them to the post-pandemic world,"When the full story of Covid-19 is written, it will likely emphasize the physiology of the disease. We will understand the scientific nature of the virus, its tenacious binding to the lung and brain, and the cascade of symptoms and immunologic reactions that determine its run through the body. 
More subtle and complicated, however, has been its disproportionate psychological impact on the lives of aging individuals who avoided the disease itself by largely staying at home and isolating themselves. If we didn't know it or believe it before the pandemic, the hard reality is now unavoidable: Social isolation cripples and it kills. As a doctor I knew the science of social isolation before the pandemic. But the pandemic has opened our eyes to the tragic consequences of loneliness in a way that was impossible before. Now, as life slowly returns to normal, let's not close our eyes to what we've learned. Let's acknowledge that despite our best efforts and technology, there is a missing element to living life by text, phone and video chat that must be illuminated and studied. And let's make sure to take the lessons of the past year and apply them to our post-pandemic world. Share Your Thoughts 
How did you combat loneliness during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. 
Consider one of my patients, who is a sad reminder of what I've seen both in my practice and in my community. From the very first waves of coronavirus that hit Miami Beach, she was fastidious about staying at home and dutifully avoiding all the previously enjoyable rhythms of life, including her beauty salon, weekly card game and favorite lunch spot. At age 90, she was among the most vulnerable of the population, and only after her second vaccine did she begin to tentatively venture out. 
But she is not the same person I knew at the outset. She is more hesitant and skittish about leaving her home, more irritable at her adult children's admonitions, and more depressed by the losses of friends and social opportunities. 
Isolations' dangers 
Of course, the dangers of social isolation and loneliness were hardly unknown before Covid-19. A major report released in 2020 concluded that prior to the pandemic an estimated 25% of older adults were socially isolated and 43% were lonely. We know that a lack of contact with others—whether family, friends or acquaintances—leads to a lack of attention to personal needs and other problems, and blocks access to care, education and services that could ameliorate those problems. 
The result is not surprising but it is stunning in its effects, with social isolation possibly having a greater impact on mortality than smoking, obesity and physical inactivity, according to the report. Despite these well-established findings, social isolation and loneliness somehow routinely escape the attention of our doctors, and the rest of us, when assessing the usual elements seen as critical to both our general health and the quality of our lives. I offer the example of another of my patients who resolved to find ways to blunt the pernicious effects of the pandemic's restrictions. He took a long walk every day. He joined Zoom classes and social groups. He would video chat with his daughter and her family on a regular basis. 
All of these efforts were meaningful to him, but they lacked the personal presence and touch he was used to. He missed the camaraderie of his colleagues, staff and patients at the doctor's office where he used to work before the pandemic pushed him into early retirement. He missed hugging his daughter and grandsons. Zoom classes were stimulating, but he couldn't make friends with other participants at the end of each class before the virtual room snapped shut. 
As his experience makes painfully clear, smiles, touches, greetings, social pleasantries and face-to-face talks, with all of their sensory elements, are the currency of a healthy mind and body. The physicality of these interactions taps into the most primal centers in our brains that serve to reassure and soothe us. They relax muscles, lower blood pressure and stress hormones, and increase endorphins. 
In short, they help us to maintain the homeostasis so vital to good health. We eat and sleep better when we eat and sleep with others. This is, in part, why people who are married or in long-term relationships live longer than those who are single people. We are filled with more purpose and joy when we pray, sing and congregate together. Sadly, it seems we needed a pandemic to remind us of that fundamental truth. 
None of this is to say that social isolation can't have its silver linings. For some people, isolation can be a blessing, giving us time to reflect, pray, study and find oneself amid the storms and strife of both everyday life and a pandemic. It can also prompt us to find ways to cope, help others, and express our wisdom and creativity through new endeavors. Indeed, many aging individuals have finally learned to master the technology of their smartphones and computers. They have started new relationships, enrolled in new classes, re-engaged with religious congregations and other communities, and become activists for a variety of causes from the comforts and confines of their homes and neighborhoods. 
Looking ahead 
But it would be foolish to think that social isolation is something to be fostered. And if there is anything this pandemic has taught us, if there is anything we have learned from this yearlong natural experiment forced upon us, it's that we need to address the high cost of isolation and loneliness in our post-pandemic world. These lessons are as profound as they are simple: 
•Technology is not a replacement for human contact. Our health depends on the physical presence of other people. Optimal social connections are sensory experiences that enable our bodies and brains to feel safe and comfortable, and to explore authentic relationships. If we confine healthcare, education, business endeavors and family meetings to video chats only, we will be missing a critical, ineffable part of the human experience that is vital to our well-being. 
•Loneliness must be taken seriously. A routine part of medical care and social services should be assessing the roles and quality of social contacts and detecting the presence and degree of loneliness, then building a social contact remediation plan into overall treatment. It is preventive medicine at it best. What's more, such social interactions must be factored into future planning for pandemics and other natural disasters that require isolation or breaking of social bonds. 
•Technology can help, but it needs to be better designed for the elderly. Most hardware and software in the internet age has been designed by and for young people with sharp eyes, nimble fingers and short attention spans. Video chats get the job done but are designed with fast on- and offramps that may obfuscate rather than emulate normal social interactions. Telehealth is still clunky and limited to the metrics that can be collected by imperfect sensors and eyeballs. Just a few ideas include bigger and more easily engaged visual and auditory fields; less abrupt starting and stopping to encourage interactions around the corners of meetings; and novel interactive features to make sessions more active and less passive experiences. 
During the pandemic, we have all missed a vital part of ourselves that is woven into our neural wiring and cannot thrive without real social connections. As the pandemic slowly ebbs and we try our best to resume the social lives we once took for granted, we must take these lessons to heart and apply them to our daily lives. We must understand that the sharp pain of social isolation that so many felt over the past year is a constant fact of life for so many of our loved ones, our acquaintances, our neighbors. 
We've seen the damage it does. Now it is time to deal with it.

Your April 18 front-page photograph of Queen Elizabeth II sitting alone in a choir stall of St. George's Chapel at the
funeral service for her husband, Prince Philip, was indescribably poignant. It was also iconic.
I can think of no other image that has so perfectly captured our experience as a world since the onset of the Covid-
19 pandemic more than a year ago. That solitary woman portrayed it all: grief, isolation, loneliness, and through it all determination, deep faith and incomparable dignity.

276,"At D.C. jail, a mass form of solitary confinement","Prisoners have been kept in cells 23 hours a day since pandemic's start 
More than a year ago, about 1,500 men and women at the D.C. jail were locked in their cells for 23 hours a day to halt the spread of the coronavirus. 
Such extreme confinement has been adopted at other jails and prisons during the pandemic as a temporary, last ditch measure. But the District's lockdown differed in a crucial way: It never ended. 
For almost 400 straight days, the entire population of the D.C. jail has been subjected to what experts say is essentially a form of mass solitary confinement - without some of the basic services afforded even to those in solitary during normal times. 
Visits were halted. The libraries were closed. So was the barber, prompting some men to grow long hair and beards. During the one hour of the day that their confinement is eased, inmates until recently were prevented from going outdoors. 
Jail officials say that what they call their ""medical stay-in-place"" policy, draconian as it might seem, has prevented the kind of covid-19 outbreaks seen at other correctional facilities. But some health experts and advocates for the incarcerated say that protective impulse has evolved into a grave human rights abuse as days and weeks have turned to months of around-the-clock confinement, either alone or with a cell mate. An overwhelming majority of the jail's inmates are Black, and many have not yet been found guilty of the crimes for which they were arrested. ""It is a very dangerous situation that you describe,"" said Craig Haney, a psychology professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz who has studied the effects of solitary confinement. Haney said a year of ""23 and 1"" lockdown would ordinarily be reserved for those who commit extraordinary breaches of prison rules, most likely involving acts of violence. 
The psychological and physical harms that such prolonged isolation can cause are legion, he added: depression, anxiety, heart disease, erosion of a sense of self and exacerbation of any existing mental illness, diabetes or hypertension. Those problems can last well after an inmate's release. 
""I understand that prisons and jails have been confronted with an extraordinary problem,"" Haney said. ""But this is not the solution."" 
From the earliest days of the pandemic, covid-19 has been a scourge for those who live or work in America's jails and prisons. Nearly 400,000 infections have been reported among prisoners and more than 2,500 have died, according to data compiled by the Marshall Project, while about 110,000 prison guards or workers have been infected and 200 of them have died. 
D.C. officials were not alone in adopting near-constant confinement as a disease-prevention measure. The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California has asserted in court documents that an ongoing 23-to-24- hour lockdown at the Tulare County jail system is unconstitutional. That policy was allegedly adopted in September, after the D.C. lockdown had already been in place for five months. 
Yet many other correctional facilities have taken a different path. No comprehensive record exists of the covid-19 containment policies in America's decentralized network of prisons and jails. But officials at a half-dozen correctional systems said the kind of across-the-board restrictions in place at the D.C. jail had either never been used or used only as a short-term approach to suppress infections. 
One official outside the nation's capital, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid publicly attacking correctional colleagues, offered a frank assessment of the District's approach: ""That's insane."" D.C. Department of Corrections Director Quincy L. Booth said the jail's policy was the only way to meet the social distancing standards established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the D.C. Department of Health. The 23-hour lockdown is necessary to limit the number of inmates commingling outside their cells within each housing block, he said. 
""Our number one purpose and goal at the DOC is to ensure the health and safety of the men and women who are in our care, as well as the staff who come to work every day,"" Booth said. ""For the most part, we have mitigated the spread in our facilities by implementing the practices that we have."" 
He said a federal judge's order in response to a class-action lawsuit brought by inmates last spring over inadequate coronavirus controls reinforced that there was ""basically no wiggle room for us to do anything different."" Among other things, that order said jail officials should ""consistently apply their stated policy of allowing no more than small groups of inmates out of their cells at any given time."" 
The debate over lockdown inside the D.C. jail mirrors the debate over lockdowns outside it. Throughout the pandemic, mayors and governors have sought to balance the dangers of covid-19 against the equally real dangers of restricting human movement, commerce and social ties. The balance has been struck many different ways, always imperfectly. 
Yet as vaccination rates rise, schools reopen and much of the world charts a course toward normalcy - even while cases surge in some parts of the country, driven by new virus variants - the lockdown at the jail continues. There is no formal plan to relax inmates' 23-hour cell confinement or benchmarks for when an easing of restrictions might begin to take place. 
D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), chairman of the judiciary and public safety committee, said he understands jail officials' desire to avert coronavirus outbreaks and comply with court oversight. But the status quo, he said, is doing ""active harm"" and cannot go on. 
""The Department of Corrections needs to have an exit strategy. I've asked for an exit strategy,"" Allen said. ""This cannot be sustained."" 
'Between four white walls'  
Victor Davis Jr. had been in jail before. The Southeast D.C. native dropped out of middle school. He was 16 when his mother died, and 18 when he was imprisoned for four years on an armed-robbery charge. After his release, he was unable to stay out of trouble or out of custody, returning to the D.C. jail multiple times. In May of last year, he found himself there again, charged with illicit gun possession. 
Now 30, Davis immediately noticed things were different as he was booked into the hulking, rust-orange jail complex that looms over million-dollar rowhouses at the edge of the Hill East neighborhood. With coronavirus cases surging in the District, he wasn't surprised at several weeks of quarantine that came before he joined the general jail population. 
The surprise came when he made his way into the familiar Central Detention Facility. Weeks before his arrival, jail administrators had put all inmates under virtually around-the-clock lockdown, allowing them to leave their cells for one hour every day on a staggered schedule. Sometimes that was at 3 a.m. Visitors were prohibited, though phone calls were allowed, as well as video conferences with lawyers. 
Hair cuts, shaves and nail trimming - all services normally performed by the barber - were unavailable, he said. Inmates did have access to a chemical hair remover, but Davis found it burned his skin and chose not to use it. He said his beard grew out and his hair turned into matted dreadlocks.  
Cosmetic problems were the least of his worries. 
With court proceedings slowed to a crawl, he did not enter a guilty plea until August. Since then, he has been awaiting sentencing, as well as court proceedings on separate charges related to an alleged conspiracy to distribute drugs. As he passed his time either alone or with a cell mate, day and night began to blend together. He slept at odd hours and talked to himself. The jail handed out tablets to inmates, but Davis said Wi-Fi access was unreliable. 
He read the newspaper, or sometimes books his family ordered through Amazon - he is now making his way through ""The Mastery of Self,"" by self-help author Don Miguel Ruiz Jr. - but that still left many hours alone with his thoughts. 
""It's mind-boggling,"" he said in a telephone interview from jail with The Washington Post. ""It makes you think about everything. You might even think back - how far can you think back? - to when you're 4, 5 years old. It's bad, to be honest. You struggle. You have to be strong mentally, not just physically. You have to be strong to be stuck between four white walls all day, every day."" 
Davis said he had observed similar struggles in other jail inmates during their brief excursions from their cells. ""You might know a dude for being cool, you know what I'm saying? He might now be angry every day, or depressed . . . that's what this brings on you."" 
Whatever the risks of covid-19 might be with fewer restrictions, Davis said, he is willing to run them. Booth, the jail director, acknowledged complaints from inmates about Internet service but said the problem was not widespread. He said inmates are able to trim their nails but was unable to explain how they are doing so. Jail officials said limited barber service resumed this month and should be available to all beginning in July. Sgt. John Rosser, a veteran D.C. correctional officer and union official, said the lockdown makes the job of guards ""10 times harder and far more dangerous"" as they deal with inmates whose nerves are fraying. Such challenges have been exacerbated, he said, by staff shortages over the past year as many officers have taken time off for self quarantine. 
Nevertheless, he said, the policy has been worth it. 
""We might be getting assaulted at a higher rate, because they're edgy and the stress levels are up. But the covid levels are not up,"" Rosser said. ""The response was kind of strict. But the answer is that the disease has been contained."" 
'An extreme circumstance'  
Although two correctional officers, one jail worker and one inmate have died of covid-19, the jail has not seen a major outbreak since the first weeks of the pandemic. Despite a constantly rotating population, fewer than 300 infections have been identified among jail inmates, according to city figures. About a third of inmates have now received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. 
Chris Geldart, the acting deputy mayor for public safety and justice, said that progress could be endangered by prematurely relaxing restrictions on inmates' movement. 
""The last thing we would want is an outbreak at the jail,"" Geldart said. ""That would not be good for anybody."" Nevertheless, officials in other correctional systems in the Washington region and across the country described less draconian approaches to managing the risks of covid-19. Many have adopted limitations on in-person visits and programs, but not 23-hour cell confinement. 
At New York City's main jail complex on Rikers Island, mingling between inmates of different housing blocks is restricted, but within those units, inmates still have much of their pre-pandemic freedom of movement, a jail spokesman said. The same is the case at the Fairfax County jail in Virginia. 
In Maryland, Montgomery County jail inmates are released from their cells for 2½ hours daily, said Angela Talley, director of the county's Department of Correction and Rehabilitation. The Prince George's County jail adopted a policy in March 2020 that allowed for roughly 22 hours of lockdown to prevent coronavirus infections, spokesman Andrew Cephas said. But in June, that was modified to allow inmates out of their cells for recreation at least three hours daily. 
Indiana's state prison system has periodically restricted some inmates to prevent infections but has ""not limited movement for long periods"" in entire prisons, a spokeswoman said. The same is true in Virginia, said Lisa Kinney, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Corrections. 
""It would take an extreme circumstance for us to have inmates locked down 23 hours a day for an extended period,"" she said. 
Jaimie Meyer, an infectious-disease physician and associate professor of medicine and public health at Yale University, has served as an expert witness in lawsuits across the country brought by incarcerated people over inadequate coronavirus controls, including the litigation in the District. The D.C. jail, she said, is the only system she examined that has adopted a continuous 23-hour lockdown since early in the pandemic. Meyer said the challenges of implementing effective disease-prevention measures inside prisons and jails - such as surveillance testing, social distancing, mask-wearing and widespread vaccination - should not be downplayed. But she said that almost uninterrupted cell confinement, even if necessary for brief periods to extinguish large outbreaks, is not an acceptable long-term alternative. 
""Temporary lockdown made sense. This extended lockdown doesn't make sense,"" Meyer said. ""This isn't meant to be a forever strategy.""

277,Even introverts feel isolation,"Although the April 12 Style article ""More than happy to stay home"" addressed some nuances in the text, the
headline presented a false dichotomy that introverts have enjoyed the isolation of the pandemic. Sure, as someone
who finds high-fives threatening, it's been easier to implement social distancing. And, yeah, it was gratifying to
avoid a grocery store interaction with a mom whose girls bullied my daughter because - masked and face-shielded
- she didn't recognize me. I've had no awkward interactions with stationery store clerks. (Their apparent interest in
the recipients of the birthday cards I purchased baffles me.) At the same time, we introverts have friends and
family and even colleagues we love, but it's hard for us to be spontaneous. I miss meeting icebreakers and team
retreats with my work colleagues; they provided structured, comfortable and meaningful opportunities for social
interaction. (It might be worth noting that I am fortunate to have a private office, with a door that closes, at my
work.) And I miss parties and happy hours with a group of parents I've now known for about a decade whose
children have not bullied my kids. Social isolation during the pandemic has been lonely for introverts like me.",4/24/21,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,4,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2
280,How isolation during this pandemic can make your chronic pain worse,"Athena Knight, who served nearly 20 years in the Army, has undergone multiple surgeries for injuries related to her
military service. As a result, she has had to cope with chronic pain for many years. She also struggles with
debilitating migraines, and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, having been inside the Pentagon during the
9/11 terrorist attack.
Until the pandemic hit, she had been able to manage her pain with physical therapy, acupuncture, meditation,
electro-stimulation, non-opioid medications and - for PTSD - in-person counseling. The coronavirus disrupted those
strategies for her and many others.
""My pain got worse,"" says Knight, 44, who lives in Silver Spring, Md., and who left active duty for the National Guard
in 2005 before retiring in 2016. ""It got worse every day.""
First, surgery scheduled on her shoulder was postponed. Then, one by one, her other appointments were canceled.
She couldn't get physical therapy or acupuncture, and - because many providers initially didn't do telemedicine -
her trauma therapist halted their sessions.
""I really went backwards in my recovery,"" she says. ""It was also mentally draining, since I also was trying to deal
with my PTSD and couldn't see my therapist. It's been a very painful year.""
About 50 million American adults suffer from chronic pain, which is among the most frequent conditions
prompting people to seek medical help, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other
research. It often results from injury, surgery or long-term diseases such as arthritis or autoimmune disorders,
among others. Chronic pain can seriously impair someone's ability to work, sleep and manage other routine
functions of daily life, such as getting dressed, cooking, driving and shopping. Many also suffer from depression
and anxiety.
""Chronic pain can be incredibly burdensome,"" says Linda Porter, director of the Office of Pain Policy at the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. ""It seems to have become a bigger problem during covid than
before covid. Isolation makes your pain worse. People couldn't get where they needed to go for care. Also, the pain
cycle often includes depression and anxiety and all of this taken together has really, really affected peoples' lives.""
Research conducted before the pandemic has found that social isolation exacerbates chronic pain for many
people.
""It is an underappreciated aspect of chronic pain,"" says Sean Mackey, professor of anesthesiology, perioperative
and pain medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center and one of the study authors. ""We lose sight of the
fact that we are social creatures by nature. We want to make medicine so much about the structure and function
of the person. But all of it is influenced by our social connectedness.
""Historically, [my] field has been driven by a biological model: find the source of pain and eliminate it. That hasn't
worked well. We tend to think all we need to do is figure out where the problem is - the back, spine or leg - and treat
it, but it's so much more complicated than that.""
A voluntary online survey conducted by the American Chronic Pain Association, an international and peer support
organization, among more than 1,000 of its members found that nearly half of the respondents reported that both
their pain and stress had increased during the past year. More than one-third said they felt depressed. Many also described feeling isolated, and said they have been exercising less.
""All of these emotions are normal for people with chronic pain, but [the pandemic] only increased those feelings,
making it even harder to cope,"" says Penney Cowan, founder and chief executive of the group. ""Everything has
been shut down and people have had to stay at home, which only increases stress.""
Many people, for example, find swimming helpful but ""with the pandemic, swimming - as well as acupuncture,
biofeedback and massage - were suddenly gone from their tool-bag of pain management,"" she says. ""Once you
break that routine, it's so hard to get back into it. People just sit there and think about their pain - and the more they
think about it, the more pain they feel.""
Gone, too, were such incentives as social occasions.
""It's easy to just get down in the chair or bed, and not want to move because it hurts,"" says Jacqueline Winfield
Fincher, immediate past president of the American College of Physicians. ""But it's basic human psychology that
when you have something to look forward to, you have a goal that motivates you to want to get better. But it's been
very hard this year because there have been no goals, no motivation.""
Fincher, an internist and primary care physician who practices in Thomson, Ga., near Augusta, says that in her
small rural town, social structure revolves around civic organizations and churches. For her patients, the loss of
those activities ""has been really tough and made all their medical problems worse, including pain,"" she says.
""We have a wonderful YMCA that holds classes that cater to our older population, the only place where they can
work out, and it's been closed. Everything has been shut down for a year, and we've seen people deteriorate in
physical function as a result.""
This hasn't been true for everyone. For certain patients, pandemic effects have underscored their resilience.
Mackey has found some of his patients have been doing better - sleeping more and feeling less fatigued - probably
because they are spending more time at home. Also, many are married and living with family, thus escaping the
debilitating impact of social isolation, he says.
""I think it has to do with social buffering,"" he says. ""The vast majority of our patients are married, and have family
members around them. The people living by themselves and disconnected from others, who don't have a social
pod or group, are having a worse time of it than before. The pandemic brings out extremes. We've seen both.""
Probably the single most important action a pain patient can take right now is to get a vaccination to protect
against covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. ""Vaccination is key because it's going to help them re-
engage with other people, friends and society sooner,"" Mackey says.
The ACPA has a guide to managing chronic pain, and will put patients in touch with a chronic pain support group,
many of them meeting via videoconferencing.
Knight is now fully vaccinated. She underwent the long delayed surgery on her shoulder last summer, and has
resumed in-person therapies. Her pain is under control again.
""Not having treatments for more than a year really hurt my body,"" she says. ""I am feeling much better now. But I
definitely don't want to go through anything like that again. Ever.""",5/11/21,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,4,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,both risks and benefits,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4
281,The pandemic actually eased my isolation,"I have been a member of my synagogue for seven years, and yet until last year my fellow congregants did not know me and I did not know them. 
They didn't know I'm a writer, disability advocate and avid consumer of whoopie pies. They didn't know I live a stone's throw from our shul and still am rarely able to get there. And they didn't know the reason for this: my chronic illness. 
I write this essay under the flashing neon sign displayed over all of our lives right now, the one that reads: ""The vaccine is here!"" A return to post-pandemic normalcy is underway. 
This leads me to a strange paradox: The conflict between despising a deadly pandemic and, at the same time, recognizing the gift it has given me. For the first time, I am able to be part of a Jewish community. This is because, while the pandemic has kept many of my fellow congregants at home for a year, I've already been there for over 30. I was brought up by artist-activist parents committed to tikkun olam - Hebrew for ""repair and improve the world."" Mostly secular, we celebrated Jewish holidays but rarely entered a synagogue. I didn't begin to embrace the importance of a Jewish community until my late 20s - coincidently, about the same time I became sick. ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) is a devastating neuroimmune disease. It often develops following an infectious illness, coming on like this: You get what you think is a normal cold, bacteria or virus, but then you never return to full health. For some, it starts after mononucleosis (caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus), just as it did for me.  
I still live with ME/CFS today, years after first getting it, along with up to 2.5 million others in the United States and 24 million around the globe. Tragically, experts are now estimating that number could double because of the coronavirus. 
More research is needed, but at this time it appears that even after the virus clears, 10 to 30 percent of those who get covid-19 from the coronavirus are remaining sick. They have post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), more commonly known as long-haul covid-19. 
If the condition persists for more than six months, a person with long-haul covid-19 could be eligible for an ME/CFS diagnosis, because the two groups share key symptoms: unrelenting exhaustion not alleviated by rest; debilitating cognitive dysfunction (brain fog); and post-exertional malaise, or collapse. That is when even small amounts of energy output cause a disproportional payback, often landing us in or near bed for unpredictably long spells.  
The downturn can last days, weeks, months or years. Yes, years. Or it can be permanent. The disease ME/CFS can be an invisible disability.  
After all, if you are homebound and bedridden you are hidden from sight. Yet, when we do manage to get out, most look healthy. So others can't tell we are struggling, even if we are barely hanging on. 
Over the years, I managed to attend high holiday services - including Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur - via audio. It was with another congregation, 100 miles away. The tech is run by a member who, in his real life, is a compassionate disability attorney. Every year I wept my way through those services, so grateful was I to be part of a larger Jewish community. 
Yet that was just once a year. 
Then along comes a global pandemic. Overnight, my own synagogue, like many others, went virtual. Just before the pandemic, my father died. I was grateful to be able to attend the Zoom evening services, which included the Mourner's Kaddish. I felt held. And suddenly I could attend an occasional Zoom Lunch and Learn led by my rabbi. There, I felt educated. Yet, best of all, I can now regularly attend Saturday's online Shabbat services. There, I feel fulfilled. 
As the general population has recently learned, and as homebound people have long known, isolation can be heartbreakingly hard. So imagine how much of a breath of fresh air it has been to join my congregation. Insta community! Being part of live Jewish gatherings has been good for me and my sometimes socially-starved soul. Of course I'm thrilled a vaccine is here. I hope life for most healthy folks will soon get back to normal. Thank goodness. 
Yet when the rest of the world goes off videoconferencing, those of us who live with health challenges and disabilities may not be able to join back in. Not at our synagogues, churches or mosques. Not at PTA meetings, Thanksgiving dinners or birthday parties. 
This past Passover is a good example.  
Because of my disability, I've missed most Seders. Then this year, to my delight, I attended two, virtually, just like everyone else. At the end of each, the Seder leaders said they hoped we would be together again next year, in person. My heart sank; I guess I'll be missing those. 
The truth is, even if I had the strength to get to a gathering in person right now, it still may not be safe for me. Yes, I'm lucky enough to be double vaccinated. But I'm unlucky enough to have a chronic illness that makes my immune system wacky. Research suggests that there is an immune system dysfunction in a subset of individuals with ME/CFS. 
So right now, it's a big unknown whether the vaccine will protect me: Will it prompt my body to make the much needed antibodies? Without antibodies, a future infection is possible.  
It's not quite time for me to let down my guard. 
I recently shared with my rabbi that I would welcome virtual participation continuing after the pandemic. He agreed, saying he also wants the inclusivity experienced during covid-19 to continue, and that the shul's board is already exploring options. 
Plus, not one to miss a teachable moment, he's now taking the lead on another project: He is organizing, with me and another disabled congregant, a Jewish Disability Awareness and Inclusion program that our entire congregation is welcome to attend - virtually, of course. 
Looking at the larger picture, virtual participation at my shul is about embracing diversity, access, inclusion, disability rights, social justice and, yes, tikkun olam. 
On a personal level, our new videoconferencing existence has expanded the world for me. I am grateful that after many years of membership, I now have an opportunity to experience my Jewish community firsthand. health-science@washpost.com

289,Illustrating isolation: Is loneliness the biggest thing we never talk about? Enter 'Seek You' by former Chicago author Kristen Radtke,"In Maggie Nelson's ""Bluets,"" her 2009 collection of poems on grief and loss, loneliness is ""solitude with a problem."" Which is a useful way of understanding loneliness. Being alone and feeling lonely are not always the same thing. Except, of course, it's complicated. Emily Dickinson wondered: Was loneliness ""the maker of the soul""? Or its ""seal""? Does loneliness define you? Or exacerbate what's already broken? Or does it even matter? As Arthur C. Clarke wrote: ""We are either alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying."" Some of us seemed stitched together by our loneliness. Henry Kissinger once said that ""the essence"" of Richard Nixon was probably loneliness.  
OK, now forget all of that. 
Because Kristen Radtke, formerly lonely in Chicago, still occasionally lonely in Brooklyn, has written and drawn an excellent new book -- a graphic essay of sorts -- that's expansive in its approach to loneliness. To her, loneliness is a malady and sometimes a balm, sometimes a diagnosis and sometimes a lens for understanding the United States. Loneliness is among the harshest forms of punishment. Or just a misplaced sense of being out of the loop. When Radtke finally offers the clinical definition -- that gap between relationships you have and relationships you want -- it feels small. 
Not nearly existential enough. 
""Seek You: A Journey Through American Loneliness,"" the Columbia College graduate's third book, reads like a kind of sequel to her acclaimed previous graphic essay, 2017's ""Imagine Wanting Only This."" That book considered our everyday ruins -- starting with the crumbling landscape of Gary, Indiana, but then found room for Iceland and Italy, for family tragedy and art and an abiding sense of fatalism. One more book this melancholy, she'll have a High 
Lonesome trilogy. 
Do you have abandonment issues, I asked her. 
""Who doesn't?"" she said. 
Still, the fear of abandonment in ""Seek You"" -- which takes its title from ""CQ,"" or ham radio shorthand for ""anyone out there"" -- seems so acute, when Radtke notes how loneliness is often conveyed glibly by pop culture (a heroine eating at the sink, or owning cats), the harmless becomes cruel. Loneliness here is tactile, eager to bite into our vulnerability. 
""I remember my first two years in Chicago as some of my loneliest,"" she said in a phone interview. ""I was at Columbia, but I was also waiting to find my people. You're waiting for the life to start that you had always been told would happen. So I moved to Chicago from rural Wisconsin, my life is becoming what I expected. Then suddenly, I feel at sea. 
""At the same time, I also remember my first summer in Chicago -- which felt like magic. I opened my windows and the city just came in and it was unbelievably romantic. I lived in the Loop, then Humboldt Park, then Logan Square. And then I graduated and moved to Italy to work as a nanny and that whole time I'm watching my friends on Facebook, all of them back in Chicago, all together, and now I felt I made some irreparable mistake. Loneliness likes a good transition period. Which is one reason it stings for us so much."" 
A few years ago, when Radtke was on her book tour for ""Imagine Wanting Only This,"" she was speaking at a book festival in Wisconsin. It was her hometown and not many had turned out. The auditorium looked sparse. Then someone asked about her next book. 
""I said 'loneliness' and it became like a AA meeting. People would raise their hand and we started going around the room and telling stories about the time we felt the loneliest in life. Someone said they called drive-time radio shows just to talk to someone. Right there, I thought, 'Oh, I'm on to something, this universal feeling we'd prefer to ignore.' "" 
Indeed whenever she would randomly ask people to tell her about their loneliest moments, the floodgates open and the stories piled up. One part of the book is drawings of some of these people, their stories paired with word balloons beside them. 
""That became such a surprise,"" Radtke said. ""I had thought loneliness was not something we admit to, but people leaned in and gave stories with the kind of detail we tend to associate with traumas. These (moments of loneliness) were often after someone gave birth, or were pregnant, or came out, or were newly sober -- moments, in our imagination, we expect to feel the most connected. But you're rebuilding yourself."" 
I told her about the time I moved to London without an apartment and sat in a hotel room for a few nights telling myself if I had a huge mistake -- I had screwed up bad. 
""Which is why we don't talk about loneliness,"" she said. ""It feels like a personal failing."" 
Radtke, 34, is art director and deputy publisher of The Believer, the longtime literary journal from McSweeney's. She arrived at her illustrated style of essay while studying for her MFA in the University of Iowa's writing program -- she decided that some of what she had to say made more sense as a collage of images or a brief anecdote inside a word balloon. The result is less a comic and closer to the pages of a children's book, dreamy clouds of text and close-ups of objects and faces, with a touch of photorealism. 
Radtke grew up near Green Bay. She said that, from time to time, she has a predilection toward loneliness, but nothing outsized. ""Everyone where I grew up lived far away, as in any rural community. My parents were strict, my father was stoic and worked a lot. I had younger brothers. But that's the thing: You can have a strong family and feel lonely."" 
""Seek You"" began on a whim. 
Radtke found herself drawing strangers who were by themselves -- someone walking across a parking lot, someone fallen asleep on the subway, someone seen through a window sitting at home. ""They weren't inherently lonely, I was just projecting loneliness on them."" She was in her late 20s, which, studies show, is one of three peak periods for loneliness. (Your 50s and 80s being the others.) 
Americans, it appears, have been headed toward widespread loneliness for a while. 
We even have a name for this: the ""Bowling Alone"" phenomenon -- famously identified by Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam, who studied America's decades-long drift away from civic organizations, church groups, neighborhood block groups, bowling leagues. As much as it is possible in an interconnected digital age, we're becoming islands onto ourselves. The study of loneliness -- pioneered by University of Chicago neuroscientist John Cacioppo, who died in 2018 -- has identified loneliness as a form of self-preservation, and found that severe loneliness is as bad for health as smoking. It also describes loneliness as a genuine ""epidemic."" And that was before the pandemic. 
""One of the most shocking things I learned doing this book,"" Radtke said, ""was that loneliness can be contagious. One lonely person acts as a transmitter of loneliness. It makes sense: A family member cutting off people and assuming people don't want to be with them then makes the next person assume that family member doesn't want to hang out with them. And so on and so on. Soon, we imagine rejection. And what scientists have learned is that severely lonely people die prematurely and have higher blood pressure."" Loneliness releases a stress hormone in the brain -- not so different from what happens when we feel threatened. Remain in such this elevated state long enough, our ability to stave off infection erodes. ""Loneliness can remap DNA,"" she said. ""Seek You"" takes the form of a kind of lyrical probe, starting with the biological then moving in concentric circles, drawing in pop culture, sociology and history, widening the lens: There's the loneliness implicit in the use of TV sitcom laugh tracks (inserted to covey a feeling of inclusivity); there's the loneliness on the face of Diana, Princess of Wales; there's the loneliness of ""long distance dedications"" on old episodes of ""American Top 40."" One of the book's most bracing case histories concerns the 2013 tragedy of a woman in Washington State who tweeted that she'd learned her husband died in a car accident then proceeded to tweet constant updates throughout the night, including the surprise that she'd gained 800 new followers since she began tweeting about his death. ""I thought about her a long time,"" Radtke said. ""Every generation looks for a diagnosis of its ills and, from trains to television to telephones, technology is often scapegoated. Now it's social media. I get why people had ire for that woman but I also see maybe this was how she witnessed a horrible moment and how it made her feel more connected."" 
In other words, an urge born out of feeling alone resulted, presumably, in more loneliness. But then, irony is often embedded in stories and feelings of loneliness -- after all, as the cliche goes, one of the most beloved women in the world (Diana) was also one of the loneliest. Feeling alone itself is often rooted in a feeling that doesn't overlap with the facts. The story of Harry Harlow, the book's finest moment, is the story of an abusive Iowa man driven by fame whose lasting contribution to science is our understanding of how mothers and children bond. Harlow, a University of Wisconsin researcher, in one experiment, infamously separated newborn monkeys from their mothers and raised them at the bottom of inescapable enclosures. Harlow himself was treated with electroshock therapy for severe depression, and later accused of blurring the line between research and torture. 
""He was almost a cliched mad scientist,"" Radtke said. ""I was obsessed with him, actually. His reputation now is good. He was wildly important to science. But he also devoted his life to the study of the existence of love and was unable to show it himself."" 
Americans, in particular, seem to unwittingly nurture alienation through our national myths. It's a point that transforms ""Seek You"" from a rangy assemblage into more an urgent cry. Rugged individualism, independence above all, an up-by-your-bootstraps ethos, even Batman -- it's all rooted in an implicit understanding of a lonely road ahead. 
It's also false. Or rather, too easy. 
""It's one of the reasons America is such a lonely country,"" she said. ""Trust and loneliness are hugely connected. Without trust, we don't feel connected to one another. So when we go through periods like now, when we don't know what's true, a feeling of isolation creeps in. If you can't be honest with those supposed to be your community, it's alienating, destructive -- a lot of problems just expand and fissure outward from there."" You start to see the loneliness at work in the overwork, paranoia, financial anxiety, gun violence. You start to see how retaining some constant degree of loneliness is part of being human, and you feel less alone. Radtke told me she's more actively engaged with her neighborhood than when she began ""Seek You."" She knows everyone who lives on her block. She says this like it's an accomplishment. 
Because, in 2021, in the United States, it is.

290,"U.S. Drug-Overdose Deaths Soared Nearly 30% in 2020, Driven by Synthetic Opioids; Fentanyl, along with isolation and stress from Covid-19 pandemic, propelled surge, experts say","Drug-overdose deaths in the U.S. surged nearly 30% in 2020, the result of a deadlier supply and the destabilizing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic , according to preliminary federal data and public health officials. The estimated 93,331 deaths from drug overdoses last year, a record high, represent the sharpest annual increase in at least three decades, and compare with an estimated toll of 72,151 deaths in 2019, according to provisional overdose-drug data released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""That is a stunning number even for those of us who have tracked this issue,"" said Brendan Saloner, associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Our public health tools have not kept pace with the urgency of the crisis."" 
The surge, the 2020 data show, was driven largely by a proliferation of fentanyl , a powerful synthetic opioid whose use has spread across the nation. The pandemic amplified the epidemic of overdoses, bringing on social isolation, trauma and job losses, according to addiction experts and treatment providers. Overdose deaths began rising in the fall of 2019 with the spread of fentanyl, but really took off starting in March 2020, when pandemic-driven shutdowns and physical-distancing measures set in. ""It's really one of those things where 2020 turbocharged something that was already wildly out of control,"" Dr. Saloner said. 
Fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, is now frequently mixed into other widely used illicit drugs, often when the user is unaware. ""Fentanyl is poisoning our drug supply,"" said Monique Tula, executive director of the National Harm Reduction Coalition, an organization that advocates for people who use drugs and trains the harm reduction workforce. 
An estimated 57,550 people died of overdoses from synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, an increase of more than 54% over 2019, according to Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. ""Definitely fentanyl is the driving factor,"" he said. Overdose deaths from opioids overall rose nearly 37%, according to the CDC data. 
Deaths from overdoses of methamphetamine and cocaine also rose, the CDC said. 
""I can remember thinking 30,000 was an astounding number,"" said Dr. Anderson. ""Now we're three times that. It's crazy."" Final overdose death data will likely be released in December, he said. 
The deaths from drug overdoses form a twin public health crisis with Covid-19 and show how the human toll of the pandemic extends well beyond the estimated 377,883 U.S. deaths involving that disease last year. Covid-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, after heart disease and cancer, according to preliminary mortality data. Unintentional injuries, which include drug overdoses, were the fourth-leading cause. Overdose deaths are helping to drive down U.S. life expectancy , which may have suffered the largest drop last year since 1943, during World War II. 
The CDC is expected to report preliminary 2020 life-expectancy data next week. 
Many people who were receiving treatment for drug addictions or wanted it were unable to get it in the early weeks or months of the pandemic, or faced disruptions or changes in service, treatment providers say. Job losses or deaths of family and friends created stress and trauma, while office and business closures reduced social interaction, depriving some of coping mechanisms they rely on. Some people ended up homeless, on the street, where they have had trouble accessing treatment, Ms. Tula said. 
""It's about isolation, about disruption in life, and maybe exacerbation of mental-health symptoms,"" said Adam Maslowski, clinical coordinator for outpatient services for treatment provider Phoenix House in Long Island City in Queens, N.Y., who shifted to telehealth services early in the pandemic but also kept a walk-in clinic open. ""A lot of people love Zoom, but there is something about face to face contact,"" he said. The provider has offered both in-person and virtual care since last summer. 
While white people account for most drug-overdose deaths, they have risen in recent years among Black people. In Minnesota, the drug-overdose death rate for Black people was nearly twice that of white people in 2019, according to a report from the Minnesota Department of Health. Mary DeLaquil, author of the report and an epidemiologist with the department, said that while those data aren't available yet for 2020, she doesn't expect an improvement. ""I feel fairly confident saying it's not going to go down in 2020,"" she said. ""In Minnesota and nationally, we are seeing drug overdoses rise across the board."" 
Tiffany Sales had been on and off drugs for her entire adult life when she went into a casino bathroom early one morning in the first week of January this year in Atlantic City, N.J., her hometown. The 52-year-old former concessions operator was found dead later, a crack pipe in her hand, said her sister, Lisa C. Oliver. Ms. Sales had weaned herself off drugs several times, and held down supervisory-level jobs when she was clean, said Dr. Oliver, an instructional designer for a healthcare system and a grief counselor who lives in Atlanta. Normally in only sporadic touch with family members, Ms. Sales had reached out early in the pandemic. ""She left a voice mail saying, with all that's going on, I want to keep in touch,"" Dr. Oliver recalled. 
The rising death toll points to a need for urgent, comprehensive measures to address the crisis, public health and treatment experts said. 
State and local governments are seeking more than $26 billion from opioid manufacturers and distributors in lawsuits that seek to recover the costs of fighting the epidemic. 
In general, the governments allege that the pharmaceutical industry pushed opioids to be prescribed and distributed beyond what was medically necessary, creating widespread addiction that led to higher abuse of street opioid drugs such as heroin and illicit fentanyl. The companies say they sold or distributed a legal product that was prescribed by doctors necessary for pain management. 
After years of delay, three trials are under way in New York , California and West Virginia . Some cases have settled recently. Johnson &Johnson agreed in June to pay $230 million to the state of New York to resolve an opioid lawsuit . 
New York, Massachusetts and 13 other states signed on to a settlement this month with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and its owners, the Sackler family. 
The governments should use the settlement money they are expected to receive for treatment and prevention programs, including investments to help reduce disparities in communities of color, Ms. Tula said. The priority now should be to get help to people at high risk of overdoses, Dr. Saloner said. Then, more steps should be taken to make treatment easier for people in need to access, he said. They include making treatment available in pharmacies and community clinics, and removing limits on the number of patients providers can prescribe medication for opioid-use disorder. 
""We've got to try all this stuff,"" he said. ""It's beyond too late.""

291,"2020’s hidden epidemic: Fueled by isolation, mental health issues and unemployment, overdose deaths have surged","As the long, isolating days of the pandemic bled into the summer, Brian Vineyard spent his time watching movies
with his mother and hanging with friends in New Port Richey. A longtime carnival employee, he was out of work as
amusement parks had shut down.
In his wallet, the 38-year-old Vineyard carried old employee ID badges, including one dating to 2012. He also
stashed a picture of his ex-girlfriend of five years and the shepherd, Jax, they adopted. It had been about a year
since the couple split. Despite the stressors that came with the pandemic, Vineyard seemed to keep his head up,
said his mother, Paula Taylor.
But all was not well.
Around 2019, Vineyard had begun using fentanyl, she said. He told his mother he took the drug because of chronic
physical pain from a drive-by shooting in 2004 that left him with a bullet in his back.
That was his excuse to me, said Taylor, 62. He was always in pain.
On June 29, 2020, he overdosed from a combination of drugs, including fentanyl. He became one of 282 Pasco
County residents to die of an overdose in 2020, the deadliest year in over a decade.
As the pandemic tore through both the nation and Florida, drug and alcohol use has been on the rise. With it, a
surge in overdoses.
Part of recovery is reconnecting with others and becoming a part of society again, said Dianne Clarke, CEO of
Operation PAR Inc., a network of substance abuse and mental health treatment and prevention centers serving
seven counties along the West Coast of Florida. So here in the last year, weve had to isolate, which is exactly the
opposite of what recovery needs.
More than 93,000 Americans died of drug overdoses during 2020, a nearly 30 percent spike from the previous year,
according to federal data.
More than 7,400 Floridians died of drug overdoses in the yearlong period ending in November, according to data
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A year earlier, the state had reported more than 5,400 deaths
a roughly 37 percent increase from 2019 to 2020.
Tampa Bay was no exception to the trend. Pinellas County saw 524 deaths, a roughly 31 percent increase from the
previous year and a record high since 2009. Hillsborough Countys preliminary data reported 538 overdose deaths,
a nearly 74 percent rise year-over-year. Pasco Countys 282 overdose deaths from prescription drugs, illicit drugs or
a combination of the two was about 48 percent higher compared to 2019.
The increase, experts and advocates said, was driven by a deadly combination of isolation, mental health issues
and unemployment during the pandemic. It was made worse by the availability of fentanyl, a deadly synthetic
opioid. And in communities of color and low-income neighborhoods, it was exacerbated by racial disparities and
financial barriers to treatment.
Compounding factors
For 60-year-old Terry Thompson, a 2019 car accident was his tipping point. But the isolation of the pandemic the
following year didnt help.
Thompson was well-loved in St. Petersburg, known there as The Camera Man. He could sometimes be found with
five or six Polaroid cameras around his neck. He spent much of his life in the city, known for his smooth-talking and humor.
Thompson had been in recovery from an addiction to crack cocaine, but his daughter said he became addicted to
Dilaudid, a powerful opioid prescribed following his car crash.
It just ate my dad alive, said his 34-year-old daughter Terri Riley. And he was trying his hardest to get off of it.
The pandemic made things worse, she said.
He has nothing to do, nowhere to go, Riley said. But what can he do? He can take his medication, you know, he can
do it all the time.
On June 1, 2020, Thompson died of complications of an overdose from a deadly combination of drugs, including
opiates, according to medical examiners records.
On top of the isolation that led many to turn to drugs and alcohol, options for recovery morphed into conference
calls and Zoom meetings, said the Rev. Basha P. Jordan Jr. of Hope Alive Outreach in St. Petersburg.
That has become a new way of recovery for many individuals, he said. However, there are many who dont know
about that.
A recovering addict himself, Jordan started Hope Alive Outreach in 2015, moving his ministry from Baltimore. He
sees compounding issues such as homelessness, unemployment and mental health as underlying causes of the
drug epidemic.
In 2020, white Floridians made up 73 percent of overdose deaths, according to data from Florida-based nonprofit
Project Opioid. Statewide, white Floridians compose about 53 percent of the population.
Black Floridians were 10 percent of 2020 overdose deaths, up slightly from 8 percent of overdose deaths in 2019.
Hispanic Floridians made up 16 percent of overdose deaths in both years, according to the Project Opioid report.
However, the report found that Black and Hispanic Floridians were hit hard during the height of the pandemic.
Overdose deaths among Black people increased 110 percent from March to June 2020 compared to the same time
period the previous year. Deaths among Hispanics increased 67 percent, while white Floridians saw a 52 percent
increase in deaths during lockdowns, compared to the same time period in 2019.
The New York Times found that Black Americans were especially impacted by the declining pandemic economy,
too facing long-standing barriers to educational opportunities and discrimination in hiring. And following the
murder of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis, depression and anxiety spiked among
Black Americans, according to a Washington Post story that analyzed census data.
Until we address racism in America, the problem is going to continue to escalate, said Jordan, who sees
inequalities in employment and mental health as contributing to overdose disparities.
A lack of financial resources can make it difficult for those struggling with addiction to seek recovery.
Robert Palmisano of Palm Harbor knows firsthand. In January 2020, the now 37-year-old overdosed on $3 worth of
fentanyl after being sober for 13 years. He woke up in an ambulance with a sheet over his face, after paramedics
gave him four doses of Narcan, a drug used to treat overdoses in an emergency.
When Palmisano started treatment, his first appointment cost $350 out of pocket, even though he had insurance.
Now, he said he has monthly appointments with a doctor specializing in addiction treatment, costing $100 each.
Palmisano sometimes spreads out payment over the course of the month. He also takes Subutex, a medication to
help manage his addiction. Palmisano said he requests partial refills when he cant afford to pay the full $120
upfront.
The fact that its easier to go out and find the drug than it is to go out and find treatment is probably a big part of
the problem, he said.
Killing everybody that takes it
Palmisano said fentanyl is fueling the increase in overdoses.
Its not controlled, when you get something on the streets, he said. The drug is often cut with other substances,
such as Advil, aspirin, vitamin B or Tylenol, Palmisano said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the first wave of opioid overdose deaths began in the
1990s, as more doctors began prescribing opioids. The second wave took place in 2010, with an increase in heroin deaths. The latest wave of overdose deaths began in 2013, with a notable increase in fatalities involving fentanyl.
In 2020, fentanyl analogs drugs similar in chemical nature to fentanyl were involved in about 63 percent of
overdose deaths in Hillsborough County, according to data from the medical examiner. Fentanyl and similar drugs
were involved in 372 Pinellas County overdose deaths and 199 Pasco fatalities or about 71 percent of overdose
deaths in each county, medical examiners office data for the two counties shows.
Paula Taylor, whose son Brian Vineyard died of an overdose in June 2020, said shed like to see more attention paid
to fentanyl.
This fentanyl is killing everybody that takes it, she said.
When her son used it, he became a different person, Taylor said. He would try to hide it from her. But he would
sweat profusely, his mother said, and strip down out of his clothes.
And the screaming, she said, Ive never seen anything like that in my life.
Working for change
In May, the Tampa Bay Partnership launched Project Opioid Tampa Bay, with financial help from the Florida Blue
Foundation. The initiative brings together business, faith and philanthropic leaders to address the opioid crisis.
Project director and former Florida Representative Jennifer Webb, D-Gulfport, said the organization plans to spend
its first year studying the extent of the problem and determine what resources are available in the area.
Its not just an academic exercise, Webb said. It really is so that we can put together a strategic plan for the best
way of proceeding.
This years state budget also set aside at least $131 million for outreach and treatment, as well as tens of millions
of dollars to treat other types of addiction.
Some of the states money comes from a settlement with McKinsey &Company. The firm advised drugmakers such
as OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma on ways to increase sales. Florida got about $40 million in February
from the company for its involvement in the drug crisis.
The state also could get anywhere from $280 million to $400 million from a bankruptcy plan filed by Purdue
Pharma.
State senator Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg, sponsored Senate Bill 1844, which advocated for a Commission on
Mental Health and Substance Abuse to study resources available in Florida. It was eventually added on to Senate
Bill 96, which was approved by Gov. Ron DeSantis on June 29.
After the isolation of the past year, Rouson said he is optimistic.
I think its going to get better, but we need to pay attention to it, Rouson said. We need to make people aware that
its okay to ask for help.
Final days
Whenever Vineyard was high, he would talk to his friends about God, his mother said. He had been pursuing a
degree in ministry, and he wanted to use it to help others like him.
Vineyards plan was to move to Atlanta, buy an apartment complex and convert it into a rehab center for families
struggling with addiction.
Vineyard also had arranged to go to BayCare for treatment.
The night before he died, Vineyard and his mother watched a movie and ate dinner. During the pandemic, she said,
they often ordered take out.
Taylor fell asleep in her chair.
At 3:30 a.m., Vineyard texted a friend. He told her he was scheduled to enter rehab later that morning.
When his mother woke up, it was daylight. She went to see if her son was in bed. He wasnt. She found him on the
kitchen floor.
I felt him, and I knew he was gone, Taylor said. Three days before he died, he told a friend of his Man, people are
dropping like flies around here. And then he dropped.

304,"Anxious About Talking to People After Lockdown? Here's Some Advice; After months of isolation, you may feel you have nothing interesting to say. But research shows you can relax.","Dr. Samantha Boardman ( @sambmd ) is a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and assistant attending physician at Weill-Cornell Medical College in New York City. She blogs at PositivePrescription.com and is the author of ""Everyday Vitality, Turning Stress Into Strength."" 
If making conversation after more than a year of pandemic-related isolation feels awkward, you aren't alone. ""I just don't know what to talk about,"" explained one friend. Her 10-year-old son is also worried about how to interact with classmates when he returns to school in September. 
For many, the prospect of returning to school or the office or attending social events is daunting. Not only is the Delta variant creating renewed health fears, some people feel socially out of practice. What to talk about, how close to stand to others and whether to shake hands or hug are among the countless conundrums people are facing. While there are guides to help military personnel readjust to civilian life after months in a war zone, and return protocols for humanitarian workers coming home, there isn't an instruction manual on how to resume interactions with friends, co-workers and others after months of pandemic-related lockdowns and social distancing. 
Suffering from emotional whiplash and feeling like social aliens, some people might prefer to remain isolated. Generally speaking, that isn't a great idea. While avoidance may shield you from the anxiety of in-person interactions in the short-term, it isn't a long-term solution. Avoidance typically begets avoidance—that is, the more you avoid social situations, the more isolated you will feel and the harder it will become to reconnect. Decades of research in psychology has shown that the most effective way to disrupt the anxiety-avoidance loop is to confront the anxiety-provoking situation head on. This is known as exposure therapy. Those who are terrified of flying, for example, need to face their fear to get over it, which is why treatment for aerophobia often involves exposure through imagined flights, virtual reality, flight simulation and actual flying. 
Similarly, the key to rebuilding rusty social skills isn't to become a recluse but to expose yourself to social situations, even awkward ones. 
If you worry about not being witty or charming enough, take heart. Research has found that we systematically underestimate how much our conversation partners like us and enjoy our company. This is known as ""the liking gap."" 
The liking gap exposes the gulf between what we think someone else thinks and what they actually think. After a social interaction, our internal monologues can be remarkably self-critical and negative: ""I bet she thinks I'm a crashing bore."" 
""Why did I bring up politics?"" 
""Was I too nosy?"" 
""Why did I tell that story?"" 
More in experts 
The ticker tape of self-doubt distorts perception, leaving us feeling unlikable and uninteresting. In reality, people judge us less harshly than we judge ourselves. In fact, the study suggests that after people have a conversation, they are liked more than they realize. 
It might take a little while to feel normal in social situations again, but the more you do it, the more natural it will become. Meanwhile, here are some icebreakers to get a conversation going: 
""What was your greatest challenge during this past year? "" 
""What did you learn? "" 
""What are you looking forward to? "" 
Conversations are a powerful form of connection. As the study's authors observe, ""conversations have the power to turn strangers into friends, coffee dates into marriages and job interviews into jobs."" So while it is perfectly normal to feel socially inept after spending months at home, try not to shy away from talking to others. Odds are, the people you interact with like you more than you know.

307,COVID adds to isolation for some,"Before COVID-19, Pat Leseman used to marvel over her son's chock-full schedule. It wasn't unusual for Michael to
bounce from hiking club and music lessons to fitness class and glee club all in a single day.
Michael, 37, has a developmental disability from a genetic condition. When the pandemic hit, many of his favorite
activities for people with special needs switched from in-person to online. Michael has a hard time staring at a
computer, so his world got a lot smaller.
Pat says after everything shut down, Michael longed to be around people again.
""He doesn't understand this COVID thing,"" Pat says. ""He kept asking, 'Party? Party? Today, party?' I kept saying, 'Not
today. The world is sick.' ""
With the world sick for about 19 months now, Michael has stopped asking about parties. Unlike able-bodied adults,
he can't just call up a friend, go for a drive, meet up for a beer, or any of the things someone like me might take for
granted. His mom notices he fidgets a lot more than before the pandemic, sometimes even poking himself in the
eye. He easily gets frustrated in his isolation.
""It does tear my heart apart that my son is not participating in very much because he refuses to look at a screen,""
she said. ""And there are many Mikes out there.""
What makes this story even more painful is Michael is not participating in the very program Pat co-founded nearly
20 years ago. The Highland Friendship Club serves people with disabilities by offering them lifelong skills and
connections to the community. The nonprofit has been riding out the pandemic with admirable skill, but as it's
adapted, it's found that the new Zoom world order has left some behind.
When I joined Pat recently on her fern-filled back deck in St. Paul's Highland Park neighborhood, she explained the
origins of the organization. When Michael entered middle school, he and his friend John, who also has special
needs, stopped getting invited to birthday parties and couldn't participate in sports or the school play.
Their moms knew they needed to do something.
""I always say, watch out for two women with fire in their belly and passion in their soul, because they're
unstoppable,"" Pat says.
John's mother, Rosemary Fagrelius, and Pat scrounged up a few basketballs and rented out the Hillcrest
Recreation Center on a Friday night. They brought their teenage sons and invited their sons' friends. Some had
intellectual disabilities, others had physical disabilities.
It was good for the teens because it gave them something to do that was strictly theirs. A lot of kids with special
needs are expected to tag along to their brothers' and sisters' soccer games and band concerts, Rosemary
explains.
""Their whole social lives revolved around Mom, Dad and their siblings,"" she says. ""It wasn't healthy for anybody.""
But one Friday night at the rec center turned to six Friday nights.
""Rose and I look at each other and go, 'We are not going to be rec directors,' "" Pat recalls with a laugh.
So in 2002, the two moms, already busy with their full-time jobs, founded the nonprofit and scaled up. Now the
group has 200 members and offers 35 confidence-building classes a week, ranging from card-making to karaoke.
Rosemary and Pat are still on the board.
A strange thing happened during the pandemic. While the club's shift to mostly online has been hard on people like
Michael, it has opened doors for a lot of other folks across the state who didn't have many chances to make
friends or be active in their own communities. The move to Zoom also erased the biggest barrier for many:
transportation.
Enrollment in the friendship club actually shot up during COVID-19. It's a bright spot in a pandemic that has been
especially isolating for vulnerable adults.
Some of the club's members are immunocompromised and are at greater risk of being seriously sickened if
infected with the virus. Others have a hard time wearing a mask or keeping their distance from others, so the club
is staying mostly remote for now.
While Michael is vaccinated, getting there was a challenge. His mom coaxed him over six weeks with practice runs
involving the friendly poke of a meat skewer on his arm. The thought of him being hospitalized is not a risk his
parents are willing to take.
The pandemic has been hard on Pat, too. She worries about him. And the shortage of personal care assistants
means there are fewer people to lighten her load. Every day begins at 5 a.m. when she hears Michael humming like
a race car in his bed.
But Pat knows her son, and others like him, are resilient to change.
""They've had to be a Gumby their entire life,"" she said. ""Mike has been to seven schools, in and out of doctors,
teachers, and PCAs coming and going. It's the world of people with disabilities. You just become a very accepting
person. The rest of us, we'd fold.""
Until then, Michael will be waiting for the party to start. Waiting for the world to get better.",10/10/21,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2

The chief physician of a large healthcare system came to me because he wanted to ""feel more stable and have
more control over how he spent his time and energy."" Even though his obsession with work and his digital devices
was draining him, he told me he couldn't go more than a few hours without opening his email.
An entrepreneur who had just secured funding for her next venture was surprised to find that, after a day or two of
excitement and joy over her success, she felt empty. She was concerned that ""if this accomplishment isn't enough
to provide some lasting fulfillment, I don't know what will be.""
Clients constantly talked about how much they wanted to turn it all off—the breaking news and busyness and
email and social media notifications. They didn't want to be thinking constantly about what was next. Yet when
they did turn it all off, they felt unsettled and restless, fluctuating between aimlessness and angst.
They weren't alone. Even before the pandemic, Americans were reporting higher rates of clinical anxiety and
depression than ever before, with estimates showing more than one in five people suffering at any given time.
Addictions to harmful substances were also at peak levels, with increasing rates of alcoholism and the opioid
epidemic. Loneliness and social isolation were on the rise, as were exhaustion and fatigue. Needless to say, the
death, distress and dislocation of the past two years have only served to exacerbate these trends.
Now, with the end of the pandemic finally in sight, more people are beginning to reflect on the lives they want to
lead on the other side. It would be unfortunate to miss out on this chance to reset, to redefine success and how we
pursue it.
We'd all benefit from finding what I call groundedness: the internal strength and self-confidence that sustains you
through ups and downs. It is a deep reservoir of integrity and fortitude, of wholeness, out of which lasting
performance, well-being and fulfillment can emerge. Being grounded doesn't mean saying goodbye to passion,
striving and ambition. It means leaving behind your frantic, omnipresent anxiety and finding a way to express your
authentic self in the here and now.
In developing these ideas, I've drawn from research in psychology, neuroscience and sociology; age-old religious
teachings and wisdom traditions; and what I've learned over the years about real-world effectiveness. I've distilled
this work into five principles that, to my mind, serve as a road map to a different—and better—post-pandemic way
of life.
1. Accept where you are.
You can't work on something in a meaningful way if you refuse to accept where you are. Not where you want to be,
not where you think you should be, not where others think you should be—but where you are, even if it's not a good
place. This kind of radical openness is the bedrock of ""acceptance and commitment"" therapy, an approach to
mental health and well-being developed over the last four decades by Steven Hayes, a professor of psychology at the University of Nevada.
""If you cannot open up to discomfort without suppression,"" Prof. Hayes says, ""it becomes impossible to face
difficult problems in a healthy way."" I've learned this firsthand in my own experience of anxiety and depression.
Only once I stop resisting unwelcome thoughts and feelings can I take productive actions to overcome them.
It's a proven technique. According to a 2020 meta-analysis of over 130 studies published in the Journal of
Contextual Behavioral Science, this therapeutic combination of acceptance and commitment is the best approach
for dealing with a range of problems, from clinical depression and anxiety to chronic pain, substance abuse and
burnout.
The basic concept is hardly new. For millennia, Eastern wisdom traditions have taught practitioners to be wary of
the ""second arrow."" The first arrow is an event or circumstance that you cannot control; the second arrow is your
refusal to accept that event or circumstance and see it clearly for what it is. These traditions teach that the second
arrow, the one we fire at ourselves, almost always hurts worse than the first.
When I catch myself firing second arrows and resisting reality, I repeat the mantra: This is what is happening right
now, I'm doing the best I can. It helps me to stay grounded amid challenges. It also helps to remember that you
don't need to feel good to get going; you need to get going to give yourself a chance to feel good.
2. Focus on the present.
Our society celebrates efficiency and optimization, so it is only natural that we'd want to optimize ourselves. But
our brains aren't computers.
A 2001 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology found that when we are multitasking, our brains
either constantly switch between tasks or divide and conquer, allotting only a portion of our cognitive capacity to a
specific task. According to David Meyer, a psychologist at the University of Michigan and lead author of the study,
even brief mental blocks created by task switching can take up as much as 40% of someone's productive time.
Meanwhile, perhaps the foremost precondition for ""flow,"" that highly desired state of total absorption in what you
are doing, is complete presence in the moment.
It also improves our happiness. A 2008 study by researchers at Harvard found that when people are fully present
for the activity they are doing, they are much happier than when they are thinking about something else. It should
come as no surprise that such presence is the basis for enlightenment and joy across spiritual and philosophical
traditions, including Buddhism, Taoism, Stoicism, Islam and many forms of Judaism and Christianity.
Today we're more distracted than ever before. We may think that if we're not online 24/7 we'll miss out on
something and fall behind. But it's likely that the opposite is true. If we're online 24/7, we'll miss out on everything.
The best way to work on presence is to schedule—and jealously protect—blocks of time for deep-focus work, play
and connection.
3. Be patient with yourself.
To make a meaningful difference in whatever work you do, you must persist long enough to break through
inevitable plateaus. Not seeing visible progress doesn't mean that what you're doing isn't having an effect. We love
to tell stories about massive efforts and overnight breakthroughs, but they rarely exist.
Consider a 2018 study published in the journal Nature. Researchers found that while most people have a ""hot
streak"" in their career, ""a specific period during which an individual's performance is substantially better than their
typical performance,"" the timing is unpredictable. ""The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual's
sequence of works, is temporally localized, and is not associated with any detectable change in productivity,"" the
authors write.
And what do almost all hot streaks have in common? They rest on a foundation of prior work, during which
observable improvement was much less substantial.
There's a risk, of course, in doing the same thing you've always done even though you don't see clear evidence of
progress. But there's an equal risk in stopping or revamping your approach prematurely. Humans suffer from what
behavioral scientists call the ""commission bias,"" that is, the tendency to err on the side of action over inaction. If
we don't see results, we get impatient and feel a strong urge to do something—anything—to expedite our progress.
For many, this takes the form of ""Instagram-worthy"" efforts, which may feel good for a day or two but often lead,
eventually, to injury, illness or burnout.
Big gains are usually the result of consistent small steps over time. This requires patience and benefits from what I
call a ""process mind-set."" First, set a goal. Next, figure out the discrete steps toward the goal that are within your
control. Then, mostly forget about the goal and focus on executing those steps.
Judge yourself based on your level of presence and the effort you are exerting in the moment. If you catch yourself
obsessing about the goal, use that as a cue to ask yourself what you could be doing right now to help you achieve
it. Sometimes the answer may be nothing at all—resting—and that is OK too.
4. Embrace your vulnerability.
In his 1959 book, ""The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life,"" the sociologist Erving Goffman distinguished between
what he called ""front-stage"" and ""backstage"" selves. Our front-stage selves are the ones we bring to social
situations or when we're trying to delude ourselves. Our backstage selves represent who we are when we stop
acting, when we don't consider how we'll be perceived by others.
Our front-stage selves and backstage selves aren't binary. Most human behavior lies on a spectrum between the
two. But when someone spends too much time playing their front-stage self, particularly when there is a wide gap
between their front-stage and backstage selves, distress usually follows, because they feel the deception.
Recognizing and accepting our vulnerability is a crucial part of traditions like Buddhism, Taoism and Stoicism.
What they share is an emphasis on honestly exploring inner experience: opening yourself to the good, the bad, the
beautiful and the ugly of life. These traditions teach that facing your vulnerabilities helps you to more fully know
and trust yourself, and to forge intimate and nourishing bonds with others.
Recent research supports this view. In a 2018 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,
researchers from the University of Mannheim in Germany found that although people may feel weak when they
demonstrate vulnerability, such behavior tends to make others perceive them as strong, grounded and trustworthy.
""Out of fear, many individuals decide against vulnerability,"" the researchers write. ""But our findings suggest that
given the positive consequences of showing vulnerability for relationship quality, health or job performance, it
might, indeed, be beneficial to try to overcome one's fears and to choose to see the beauty in the mess of
vulnerable situations.""
Practicing vulnerability starts with asking yourself what you actually feel in a given situation and then letting
others know about it, or at least something close to it. Everyone has fragilities and flaws, and we can build strength
and self-confidence by sharing them.
5. Find community.
The incessant drive to be productive may help us to get ahead in the short run, but it is detrimental to our social,
spiritual and psychological well-being in the long run. It crowds out time and energy that we could devote to
forging closer bonds to family and friends and to experiences and traditions that give us a deeper sense of
belonging. As the psychologist and philosopher Erich Fromm put it in ""Escape From Freedom,"" his influential 1941
book, ""To feel completely alone and isolated leads to mental disintegration just as physical starvation leads to
death.""
A large body of research conducted by the late University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo shows that
loneliness is associated with anxiety, depression, burnout and feelings of being unmoored. As Cacioppo
emphasized, our species evolved in close-knit groups, and finding a place in a deep community is one of our
abiding needs.
None of this is news to our great religious traditions. As St. Augustine remarked in a famous 4th-century sermon,
""In this world, two things are essential: life and friendship. Both should be highly prized, and we must not
undervalue them."" They are ""nature's gifts."" In one ancient Buddhist text, the Buddha's loyal attendant, Ananda,
approaches and asks, ""Venerable sir, this is half of the spiritual life, that is, good friendship, good companionship,
good comradeship."" The Buddha replies enthusiastically but sternly: ""Not so, Ananda! Not so! This—good
friendship, good companionship, and good comradeship—is the entire spiritual life.""
On our deathbeds we are likely to dwell not on that big promotion, glittering award or other outward achievement
but on the bonds we forged with other people along the way. Deep community provides us with spaces where we
can support each other through ups and downs. It's where we find the relationships that keep us grounded.
These principles have always been the foundation of a good life, but in the rush and anxiety of modern work, we've
lost sight of them. The disruption of the pandemic has given us an opportunity to reconsider—and to start again.

315,Youths facing mental health crisis; Surgeon general issues advisory to focus attention on problems made worse by pandemic isolation.,"Citing mounting evidence of ongoing harm, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy on Tuesday issued a public health advisory on the mental health challenges confronting youths, a rare warning and call to action to address what he called an emerging crisis exacerbated by pandemic hardships. 
Symptoms of depression and anxiety have doubled during the pandemic, with 25% of youths experiencing depressive symptoms and 20% experiencing anxiety symptoms, according to Murthy's 53-page advisory. There also appear to be increases in negative emotions or behaviors such as impulsivity and irritability -- associated with conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
And, in early 2021, emergency department visits in the United States for suspected suicide attempts were 51% higher for adolescent girls and 4% higher for adolescent boys compared with the same time period in early 2019, according to research cited in the advisory. 
""It would be a tragedy if we beat back one public health crisis only to allow another to grow in its place,"" Murthy said in a preface to the advisory. ""Mental health challenges in children, adolescents, and young adults are real, and they are widespread. But most importantly, they are treatable, and often preventable."" 
Even before the pandemic, children from all backgrounds faced serious mental health challenges, Murthy said. But nearly two years of disruption took a toll and worsened their mental health -- especially for such groups as immigrants, students with disabilities and students of color from low-income families. 
At the same time, pandemic-related safety measures reduced in-person interactions among children, friends, social supports and professionals such as teachers, school counselors, pediatricians and child welfare workers. This isolation made it ""harder to recognize signs of child abuse, mental health concerns, and other challenges,"" the advisory states. 
""This is unprecedented, the amount of trauma that our students are experiencing on a mass scale,"" said Loretta Whitson, executive director of the California Assn. of School Counselors. 
A surgeon general's advisory is a public statement intended to focus national attention on an urgent public health issue and provide recommendations for how it should be addressed. ""Advisories are reserved for significant public health challenges that need the nation's immediate awareness and action,"" the document said. The advisory calls for a broad-based and rapid response from government, social media companies, community groups, schools, teachers, parents and even students --and listed resources available to them. Murthy issued his advisory the day after a quick visit to King/Drew Magnet High School of Medicine and Science, a campus of high achievers that is, comparatively speaking, well staffed for mental health support and is adjacent to a regional medical center and medical school in the Willowbrook area of South Los Angeles. But even here, students have been struggling, said Jesus El, a 17-year-old senior. Despite concerted efforts from teachers, many students became disengaged after campuses shut down and learning moved online to the Zoom format. 
""For most of my classes, it was just names in a box -- no microphones being turned on, no cameras, no chat,""
Jesus said. ""Unless the teacher says: 'Say yes, if you're still here,' it was just ghost town, kind of."" And students also are having difficulties adjusting to the resumption of in-person schooling. ""A lot of people still feel like everything is virtual, like, they act as if we can't see or hear what they say,"" Jesus said. ""A lot of students have been less motivated to come to school, you know, miss school more. I'm noticing a lot more students start to leave class and take long bathroom breaks."" 
This fall Jesus was part of an effort to launch a school mental health club, which works to help students understand when and where to seek help, and to destigmatize the experience. 
It's the kind of youth-initiated model cited in the advisory. 
Similarly, senior Sydnee Breda-Nixon, 17, looks out for friends. 
""I tend to notice when something is wrong,"" she said, ""whether it be how they're texting, or how they're talking to me, or how they're reacting to certain things that I've done or said. If I see it on like Tuesday, I'll ask them on maybe Wednesday -- because you don't want to just let them go through it all by themselves, because then that becomes something that is hard to take on."" 
In an interview, Murthy underscored the importance of friends, parents and teachers being attentive to changes in mood, behavior and interests. He noted that mental health symptoms in youths frequently become evident 10 years before they begin to be addressed. 
Sydnee wasn't doing so well herself. For a time, she lost interest in activities and engaging with family and friends. The pandemic made everything feel so dull and hopeless, she said, but her bond with an older sister helped pull her out. 
Murthy also emphasized the role institutions play in creating accessible and seamless mental health support and noted that pandemic-relief aid -- billions of dollars went to the Los Angeles Unified School District alone -- is supposed to target mental health. 
Like many other school systems, L.A. Unified has struggled to find available mental health professionals, falling about 500 social workers short of this year's hiring goals, said school board member Tanya Ortiz Franklin. ""One good thing is that people are asking for help and trying to offer it to one another, even informally and without professional expertise,"" Franklin said. ""But we are also recognizing the deep need for professional expertise."" The national average of caseloads for school counselors remains high, with 424 students per counselor for the 2019-20 school year. 
Professional guidelines recommend a ratio of 250 students per counselor. 
Historically, the problem has been the lack of money to hire counselors. For now, the money is there, but the professionals are not. 
The advisory recommends that government -- at the local, tribal, state and federal level -- invest in a pipeline for counselors, nurses, social workers and school psychologists. 
Daniel Eisenberg, a professor of health policy of management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he agreed with the advisory's holistic approach in taking on problems that had been worsening long before the pandemic. 
""This is an issue that really requires a long-term investment from all the stakeholders mentioned in the advisory, our entire society ... for years and decades to come,"" Eisenberg said. 
A positive sign is that ""young people are very knowledgeable and energized about mental health as an issue,"" Eisenberg said. 
The surgeon general has limited direct power, but traditionally speaks with medical expertise as the voice of the executive branch -- a role that can be magnified by the individual in the office and the issues that person takes on. The surgeon general's warning on tobacco products is a well-known example. 
Murtry is on his second tour of duty. He also served as surgeon general from 2014-17, appointed by President Obama. 
The latest advisory is his second during the Biden administration. His first flagged the ""urgent threat"" of medical misinformation, calling on tech and social media companies to operate more responsibly. 
Murthy said there's a connection between the two advisories because misinformation can amplify polarization, ""and that actually creates a really stressful environment."" 
""I've learned from my own small children -- they're very sensitive to disagreement around them, whether their parents are arguing or other people are arguing."" 
Some of the recommendations seem aspirational, like asking technology companies to step up, said Robin H. Gurwitch, a psychologist and professor at Duke University Medical Center. 
But aiming high is better than settling for the status quo, she said. 
""I really do believe that this advisory infuses hope and if nothing else, carries hope forward that things can be better. Oftentimes, right now with COVID, mental health has taken so many hits."" 
With the advisory, she said, there's hope that, ""we can begin to shed some light on the issues and truly move forward in a productive way.""",12/7/21,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
316,Feeling truly alone? Here are ways to fight it.,"I am lonely.
Okay, not all the time. I do have good friends, and a loving family. Heck, I even have a puppy. But I'm divorced, and
several close friends - including a beloved ex - have died in recent years, and I'm feeling those losses deeply these
days. And Zoom connections, still a part of my life, are just not as soul-filling as face-to-face ones.
To be honest, it makes me feel vulnerable, or that something is wrong with me, to acknowledge this loneliness.
There's a stigma, like, ""What's the matter with him?"" or as a physician wrote earlier this year, ""Culturally loneliness
can be seen as a sign of weakness or self-pity.""
But am I alone in feeling this way? Hardly.
""Covid made more people lonely and made lonely people lonelier,"" Harvard psychologist Richard Weissbourd says.
He blames increased social isolation and pandemic-related anxiety, grief and depression, which often fuel each
other.
But the depth and prevalence of our loneliness is not new.
Between 2018 and 2019, loneliness in the United States surged seven percentage points, according to a Cigna
study. That translated to 61 percent of Americans, or 3 in 5 adults, who described themselves as lonely. And that
was before the pandemic. In this second isolated year, researchers fear the problem may be getting worse. Even in
""normal times,"" Weissbourd says, the rate of loneliness ""is a deep societal failure.""
Case in point: A few months ago I gave a talk on Meetup, the social media site, about loneliness and social
isolation, a subject I learned a lot about in researching a book about aging.
I was dumbstruck when nearly 2,500 people joined the one-hour conversation in the middle of a workday. The
hundreds of questions asked had a few common themes, including how to make new friends in a time when
socializing has become dangerous for some people, and how to find meaning in life after retirement and, most
basically, how to connect with others. It was painfully clear how deeply people crave connection.
The audience represented all generations, from boomers to Gen Z. Loneliness is clearly an equal-opportunity
affliction.
Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University, studies
loneliness. She said that her data shows that younger people are at high risk, as are those living alone, or who have
financial insecurity or existing mental and physical health issues. Retirement and mobility issues may lead to
isolation, which is often a proxy for loneliness. Other recent research has identified immigrants and LGBTQ people
as being at high risk for loneliness.
Add all that together and that's a lot of us.
It's pretty self-evident that loneliness is not good for mental health. Researchers have linked it to higher rates of
depression, anxiety and suicide. But only recently, says Holt-Lunstad, have we better understood the potential
impact on our physical health, which includes a 29 percent increased risk of heart disease and a 32 percent
increased risk of stroke. It carries a significantly increased risk of premature death from all causes - a risk that may
rival those of smoking, obesity and physical inactivity.
I used to think that being alone was synonymous with loneliness. Turns out there's a big difference between the
two, which U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy, author of ""Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in
a Sometimes Lonely World,"" says has to do with how you experience that aloneness.
""Loneliness,"" he's wrote ""is a subjective feeling that the human connections we need in our life are greater than the
human connections we have. . . . You could be surrounded by just one or two people and feel perfectly content if
you have strong relationships with them.""
For instance, two years ago I went on a meditation retreat with 25 others, but I spoke with no one, curiously feeling
connected to the group anyway and successfully finding a connection with myself. When I've gone hiking with my
dog, I rarely feel lonely as I listen to birdsong and watch the great monarchs flitter and flutter. Holt-Lunstad's
research also supports this distinction: ""Someone may be lonely but not isolated or they may be isolated but not
lonely.""
On the other hand, I have felt extremely lonely when I was not alone at all. There's probably no more crushing
loneliness than that experienced in a faltering relationship, which I realized during the end of my marriage. As Holt-
Lunstad pointed out, those alone by choice were at lesser risk of severe loneliness during the pandemic than say,
widows and widowers, who had no choice in the matter.
Holt-Lunstad, whose current research is focused on interventions for loneliness, has some practical suggestions,
all based on recent studies:
First, try mindful meditation. (There are a large number of apps - some free, some paid - that can be useful for
beginners. Headspace, 10 Percent, and Deepak Chopra's app are among those I've used.)
Second, try expressing gratitude, or giving thanks to others.
During the pandemic, Holt-Lunstad conducted a study that found that performing small acts of kindness for
neighbors over four weeks was associated with a significant reduction in loneliness. It almost didn't matter what
someone did: took out the neighbor's recycling, baked some muffins or offered to walk their dog. Anything that
increased a sense of connection worked.
Jeremy Nobel, a Harvard physician and the founder and president of the UnLonely Project, provided a third
suggestion: Focuson ""authentic connection,"" which he says requires more than just breathing the same air as
others (which we can't even do these days without precautions).
He said that forging real connection with others - dropping the facade, showing vulnerability and sharing one's true
feelings - starts with being connected with yourself, knowing what matters to you and what you care about.
That's easier said than done, which is why he promotes the arts to help people, at any level of talent, to find, shape
and share their personal stories. Nobel has found that art ""allows us to express ourselves in ways that unhide us
and reveal who we are.""
That resonates with me. I'm a mentor in a hospital writing program where I'm matched with individuals who've
been diagnosed with cancer. The ""space"" that we create allows for real connections, which probably would not
happen otherwise.
A young woman I worked with in this program put it like this: ""My journey into creative expression has all created a
richer sense of who I am and what I value. It's also allowed me to shape the events of my past in a way that feels
empowering instead of stifling.""
For those who think that writing on social media might serve the same purpose, Nobel said he believes it often
""deepens loneliness.""
I've found that I'll see Instagram photos of friends on vacation, at a party I wasn't invited to, and just like that any
sense of aloneness morphs into loneliness. Nobel said we need to find a better way of using social media.
""Share awkward or unflattering aspects of yourself . . . that might resonate with others and invite compassion and
empathy [instead] of continuous spooling self-proclamations of success,"" he says.
But where to start? Nobel says he hopes ""we'll remember that it's okay to say, 'I'm lonely.' ""
It's the perfect antidote, I've found, to loneliness.",12/7/21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,7,6
317,"In a Time of Crisis, a City Fights Isolation","FROME, England —For more than 1,000 years, this market city was best known for products made from wool and woven fabrics and later for its large iron statues, including the Lady Justice figure that still sits atop the dome of
the Old Bailey court about 100 miles east in London. 
But these days, Frome has been getting attention for something far more unusual and urgent: its fight against loneliness. 
Frome’s approach to the global human affliction began as an experiment by a local physician, Dr. Helen Kingston, eight years ago. It caught the attention of publications of all kinds, including The New York Times, and has been studied and replicated by countries around the world. The urgency has only been exacerbated by the raging pandemic. 
The work by Kingston and her team was first recognized by then-Prime Minister Theresa May —who appointed a member of Parliament, Tracey Crouch, as the first minister for loneliness in 2018. But the Frome Model, as it is known, reached a milestone a few weeks ago when the National Health Service in Britain locked in permanent funding for the program after years of patchwork financial support. 
The efforts haven’t ended at Frome. In November, the government of Victoria, Australia, agreed to create the position, and Japan added one in February amid rising suicide rates. Cities around Britain and as far away as Sweden and Colombia are studying Frome’s experience and hoping to copy its success in reducing emergency hospital admissions, an achievement that is gold dust in a time of rising health costs. 
So why Frome? And what was so special about its approach? 
The effort begun here is based on a model of health care driven by the local medical clinic, the Frome Medical Practice, that seeks to improve the emotional well-being of patients by tapping into community connections and volunteer groups to help people deal with such problems as loneliness and social isolation, which are not usually viewed as medical problems. 
“If this was a franchise, it would be a very attractive one to sell,” said Will Palmer, a 59-year-old fashion industry consultant who helps British brands enter foreign markets. 
Palmer doubles as one of Frome’s “health connectors,” who link people to community groups and services ranging from home heating advice to help with hearing aids and cooking lessons. 
One of the most striking things about the Frome idea is that apart from eight paid connectors like Palmer, this city of just under 30,000 has also trained 1,140 voluntary “community connectors.” Cafe owners, taxi drivers and other ordinary residents have been taught how to advise friends and neighbors about the community groups and services that often go underused for the simple reason that people do not know they exist. Palmer’s specialty is getting people digitally connected. Recently he was sitting in the Cheese and Grain Cafe giving smartphone lessons to John Willis, a 77-year-old retired builder who feels his generation is being isolated by the rise of online shopping and government services. 
“We are being left behind,” Willis said. “Everyone communicates online nowadays, and you have to pay through the nose if you can’t shop online.” 
Willis’ digital lessons were organized through the medical practice, along with advice on how to reduce large utility bills that were worrying him after the death of his ex-wife, Eileen, 18 months ago left him depressed and anxious. “I was on the verge of a mental breakdown and had terrible headaches and stress,” he said. “I couldn’t be bothered going out or seeing anyone, but it’s hard to say you’re lonely because you are supposed to be a hard man.” Palmer and his team of 70 volunteer “digital connectors,” who help point people toward digital training and free Wi Fi or donated electronic devices, are just part of a vibrant network of community services that can be mobilized to deal with some of the emotional issues that often exacerbate people’s health problems.  In the parking lot outside the coffee shop, several unused toilets have been converted to a community fridge, which dispenses donated food to whoever wants it, and the Frome Coat Rack offering free jackets and other clothes. 
A few meters away is the Talking Bench, a wooden seat where Hayley Morgan, health connector, and Janet Copsey, a volunteer, wait each Wednesday morning to talk to anyone who just wants to chat or is looking for advice about the often bewildering lineup of community groups in Frome. 
Copsey, 60, has been trained to advise people about everything from joining choirs and sports groups to finding
tips on green lifestyles. 
The Talking Bench is an offshoot of a popular Talking Café, where strangers can get together; Copsey is also involved in a postcard-writing project that sends friendly missives to people with little social contact. Just around the corner is Share, a nonprofit “library of things” that cuts waste by lending items ranging from donated power tools to geothermal cameras for monitoring home heat loss. 
While many cities have vibrant community networks, the unusual thing about Frome’s initiative is the role of the medical practice in mobilizing them as part of a deliberate strategy to strengthen patients’ resilience and well being. 
Kingston, 56, has worked at the Frome Medical Practice for 26 years, spending much of that time frustrated that her patients often needed more than a drug. But she lacked the resources to help them with the nonmedical stresses and crises exacerbating their health problems. 
In 2013, she won National Health Service funding for her practice and for the wider local government district of Mendip, with its population of 115,000, to employ Jenny Hartnoll, a dynamic community development worker who wanted to compile a guide to existing community services and to see whether there were any obvious gaps that could be filled by new groups. 
“Because we’re on the edge of Somerset (county) they let us get on with things, and our practice was big enough to do things at scale but not so big that you had to have a committee of 50 people making decisions when you wanted to try something new,” Kingston said. 
“It’s not just lonely people who benefit from more social connections. We all have that basic human need, and by recognizing that fact you can support people instead of waiting until there’s a crisis,” she added. “If the real reason you are depressed and not sleeping is that you’re bereaved or have lost your job, then no pill is going to cure that but just asking people what’s on their mind helps you to formulate a better plan for them.” The practice now employs the health connectors, who earn 20,000 pounds to 26,000 pounds a year (about $26,450 to $34,400; some are part time), and a team of nurses to reach out to vulnerable people who need support. The community development work led by Hartnoll means the nurses and doctors know what services are available to help each person, and the hundreds of community connectors trained by her team are spreading that information even further. 
Hartnoll, 54, encouraged retired software worker Patrick Abrahams, 70, for instance, to set up a Men’s Shed, which now offers two weekly sessions where men and women can gather to share woodworking and other projects, often repairing things for services like the Community Fridge and the local hospital. 
Ron Carver, an 87-year-old retired master carpenter who is known as “El Presidente” of the shed, said he enjoys passing on his skills, “but the camaraderie is what you really want.” 
“A lot of us are on our own, so it’s great to get together,” said Carver, whose most recent project was a small wooden coffin for the ashes of his wife, Iris, who died in 2018. 
Dr. Julian Abel, a retired palliative care consultant, said the results in Frome of fostering human relationships and a more compassionate community as a part of medical care amounted to “a medical miracle.” It was Abel who got access to local medical data in 2018 and published a report, peer-reviewed and published by the British Journal of General Practice, showing that from 2013-17, when the program was underway, emergency hospital admissions in Frome fell by 14% while they rose by 29% in the broader county of Somerset, even though the demographics are similar. 
“There are no other interventions which have ever reduced population emergency admissions like this,” he said. Hartnoll shies away from the idea that loneliness has been or could ever be eradicated and said her work has been helped by having a town council that is innovative and focused on community development. Nonetheless, Frome’s reputation has been transformed from that of a place where it could be dangerous to go into town on a Saturday night 20 years ago to an unusually friendly and caring community, helping to attract an influx of middle-class newcomers from London and elsewhere. 
One result —unhappy to some —has been a surge in home prices, prompting a backlash from some longtime residents. 
Andy Wrintmore, a 6-foot-9 drummer in a punk rock band who was elected Frome’s mayor this year, said he cannot afford to buy a house, “so I can see why some ‘Old Fromies’ are not happy.” 
“But I still think the changes in the community have been fantastic,” the 29-year-old mayor said. Hartnoll is adamant that there is nothing special about Frome that suggests the model cannot succeed elsewhere.  The Mendip district is ethnically homogeneous —in the 2011 census, 98.7% of household leaders were white —but the city has enough economic problems to dispel any notion that it is some ideal community, she said. Hartnoll’s team is struggling to keep up with international requests for information and training, work that is not covered by its National Health Service funding and would ideally be funded by international philanthropy. Marcello Bertotti, a senior research fellow at the University of East London, said Frome was “at the vanguard” of the growing movement to better incorporate nonclinical solutions into medical care. 
“Since 2019 the NHS has funded 1,470 community ‘link workers’ in medical practices around the country but Frome has been really pioneering by also having all those volunteer community connectors,” he said. “Cities all around the world are taking notice.” 
Before COVID-19 arrived, the Frome team was visited by interested groups from Hong Kong, Colombia, Italy, Australia and elsewhere, and in the past eight months it has given online advice to others from Denmark, Portugal, and Ontario and British Columbia, Canada. 
Friends in Umea, a community group from the Swedish city, has conducted a series of Zoom meetings with Hartnoll’s team and is working with doctors and nonprofit groups to copy some of its approach. “We are suggesting a model similar to the one in Frome and we are on our way from theory to practice,” said Bjerre Ljungberg, one of the group’s board members. “It feels like we are taking part in a worldwide network against loneliness.""

325,"Magic' Multigenerational Housing Aims to Alleviate Social Isolation; Two co-living communities set to break ground this year seek to address loneliness, as well as the caregiving and affordable-housing shortages, in the U.S.","The Future of Everything covers the innovation and technology transforming the way we live, work and play, with monthly issues on transportation , health , education and more. This month is Well-Being , online starting Jan. 6
and in print Jan. 13. 
The U.S. is facing an aging population, a shortage of caregivers , a dearth of affordable housing and an increase in social isolation that threatens well-being. Some think what we really need is Magic. 
That is, multi-ability, multigenerational, inclusive co-living, or communities where young and old, families and singles, live side by side, supported by inclusive design, technology and neighbors. Rethinking community in this way could reshape how and where older adults and people with disabilities live and receive care, while building symbiotic relationships between people of all ages, supporters say. 
Magic is the brainchild of geriatrician William Thomas, who spent decades working to improve long-term care. Spurred by a belief that segregating older adults, as well as people with special needs, negatively impacts their well-being, Dr. Thomas co-founded Kallimos Communities to develop neighborhoods based on Magic principles. Groundbreaking is expected to begin in the second half of 2022 on two neighboring 7.5-acre communities in Colorado—the first of what he hopes will be many across the country. 
Others in the caregiving field are reimagining the way people live and care for each other and coming up with similar solutions. Another Magic community, the Village of Hope, is slated to start construction in the spring in rural Pennsylvania, catering to parents with adult children with disabilities, grandparents raising grandchildren and those with early onset Alzheimer's. 
Marc Freedman, chief executive of Encore.org, a nonprofit working to promote intergenerational connection and second careers, says the U.S. is among the most age-segregated countries in the world, which has led to ageism and loneliness. Magic communities could help counter that, he says. 
""Housing and community design can be used to rectify some of the wrongs we see,"" says Mr. Freedman. Intentional intergenerational models exist in small pockets around the country, where preschools operate in assisted living facilities, and on a grand scale in Singapore, he says, where the government is spending $2.4 billion to build three-generation flats and housing developments that have space for both elder care and child care. Creating new communities, rather than offering services in existing ones, faces special challenges, including startup costs and getting people to move into them. About 70% of adults 50 and older want to ""age in place,"" remaining in their homes for the long term, according to a 2021 AARP survey of nearly 3,000 U.S. adults. Kallimos Communities aren't meant to replace long-term-care facilities or aging in place, Dr. Thomas says. ""Not everyone wants to stay in their house. For some people, there are negative consequences—social isolation, undernutrition, financial abuse, injury,"" he says. 
The first of Dr. Thomas's Kallimos Communities, in Loveland, Colo., will consist of two communities, each with up to 50 rental homes, designed for people of all ages and abilities. Kallimos will employ staff, known as ""weavers,"" to meet residents, introduce them to each other and plan meals and activities in the common areas. They would work closely with ""keepers,"" staff who would help residents with transportation, cleaning and cooking. ""We're creating a community founded on reciprocity,"" says Dr. Thomas. Other Kallimos Communities, the name derived from a Greek word meaning beautiful, are planned for Texas and New England, but are still in the early stages. 
The Loveland community, built with the Loveland Housing Authority, a city agency which will develop and own the property, will include communal space and gardens. Houses will be studios to two-bedrooms and universally designed, with wider doorways and hallways, no steps, and showers that are flush with the floor to accommodate people of all abilities. Residents can pay for additional technology, such as motorized lift systems mounted to the ceiling and adjustable countertops for those with disabilities and confined to wheelchairs. Rents haven't been set yet but will be aimed at the middle of the market. 
""When it comes to aging, a small house equals big life. Big house equals small life,"" says Dr. Thomas. Weavers would connect neighbors to foster reciprocity, says Megan Marama, chief operating officer of Kallimos, which will manage the community. For example, a person with dementia who loves to garden could contribute by helping tend flowers. 
Magic communities could also appeal to younger people, including students, looking for less expensive housing 
and more inclusive neighborhoods. ""There are a lot of younger people who are attracted to neighborliness and close relationships with people around them,"" says Dr. Thomas. 
The Village of Hope, in Clearfield County, Pa., addresses the area's shortage of affordable housing—the local senior high-rise apartment building has a three-year waiting list—as well as increasingly complex needs for caregivers. ""We have grandparents raising grandkids, in part because of the drug epidemic,"" says Kathleen Gillespie, CEO of the nonprofit Clearfield County Area Agency on Aging, which is developing the project. She spent 25 to 30 years working in long-term care, including as a nursing-home administrator. 
Older parents who have adult children with disabilities are exhausted and worry about what will happen to their children if they become ill or frail, she says. Being in the Village of Hope would offer them peace of mind, she says. Single-family homes, duplexes and triplexes ranging from 900 to 1,500 square feet, some with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, will rent for about $900 a month, including utilities and grounds maintenance. Each will be compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act requirements and equipped with high-speed broadband to accommodate telehealth. A 15,000-square-foot Village Hall will have a grocery store, cafe, fitness center, adult day center, community arts space, and an office to support and coordinate services. 
Residents, including single parents, can receive reduced rent in exchange for helping their older neighbors with small chores and transportation, who in turn might be able to provide limited child care. The Area Agency on Aging is tapping public and private lending geared toward rural housing to build the homes and plans to use the federal and state Home and Community Based Service program to fund support services provided to residents. 
Gary Smith, lead developer for the project, spent four decades developing skilled nursing facilities. ""I realized what I did for 45 years was completely wrong,"" says Mr. Smith, an executive adviser to Avenue Development. ""We shouldn't be segregating people.""",1/10/22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2
332,Our cells 'listen for loneliness'; 'So lonely you could die' isn't just a song lyric. Neurogenomics is proving the human nervous system is not well suited to isolation.,"My curiosity about my leukocytes started before the pandemic. I was motivated by the oldest and most basic grief
we experience: the loss of love. But the lessons from my heartache and the emerging neurogenomics of loneliness
have much to offer our strange moment in time.
I was late to join the heartbreak club. I met the man who would become my husband when I was 18, on my first day
of college. After our 25-year marriage ended in 2017, I was stunned by the pain, by the swiftness with which grief
engulfed me. There was so much loss: of the physicality of him; of my sense of self; of my grasp on a predictable,
secure future. Then there was the loss of my health. I was shedding weight I didn’t want to lose, barely sleeping,
and my pancreas suddenly stopped producing enough insulin. I was tipping into diabetes. My body felt like it was
plugged into a faulty electrical socket.
Where was the science? Why was heartbreak so physical? After a million years of hominins sighing at the moon
over lost love, what had we figured out?
At first, it appeared Omicron might be a “great unifier,” spreading equally through the county, but then it took a turn
toward lower-income communities of color.
The rejection piece was one part of it. We humans are very sensitive to social slights both large and small. But the
loneliness piece was another, and it’s the one with the lessons I keep coming back to. Although many of us happily
embrace solo living —after a divorce, during a pandemic —our ancient nervous systems are not well suited to it.
As we slouch through another month of pandemic and stare down another season of heart-shaped chocolates, it’s
worth taking a closer look at the toll loneliness can take.
By now, much is known about the health risks of both being socially isolated and feeling lonely (and it is subjective
feeling; it aligns with isolation, but not always). People who identify as one or the other —or both —face higher
risks of inflammation-driven diseases like stroke and heart disease, dementia, some cancers and, yes, diabetes.
Across studies of many people in many countries, epidemiologists find consistent correlations between social
state, disease progression and early death.
Unfortunately for me, they also find a relationship between these diseases and being divorced. “There is an
inflammation story related to divorce,” as David Sbarra told me. A psychologist at the University of Arizona, he co-
authored a review paper in 2011 that found a 23% increased risk of early death for divorced people compared with
married people.
To find out how that was playing out for me, over two years I deposited vials of blood in the lab of Steven Cole, a
neurogenomics expert at the UCLA School of Medicine. Did my immune cells, in fact, look like those of a lonely
person, and if so, was anything I was trying to do to feel better working?
Cole’s interest in how social identity influences health began in 1997, when he and his team discovered that HIV-
positive gay men who were closeted suffered quicker immune cell declines and a faster onset of AIDS than those
who were out. Somehow their nervous systems, informed by stress-inducing social circumstances beyond just the
stress of the diagnosis, were nudging them into sickness. Cole has spent the last 20 years identifying immune-
related genes in cells that, in his words, “listen for loneliness.”
Those who are still cautious about the virus are made to feel silly or foolish these days, even as L.A. hits its
pandemic peak.
In 2007, Cole and others published a paper finding that generally healthy people with weaker social connections
had alterations in a key set of genes governing the behavior of certain leukocytes —white blood cells —that help
fight disease. The research provided a strong clue as to why lonely people may face a higher risk of chronic
inflammation. Since then, Cole has tried to figure out why social disconnection triggers about 200 genes to brew
what he calls “a molecular soup of death.”
Of course, there are a lot of complicating factors facing people living alone. They tend to smoke more and exercise
less. They are twice as likely to face poverty as their partnered peers. Experiments with animals who are as
naturally sociable as we are can provide cleaner data.
In a study published in December in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, researchers at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine placed 35 pigtailed macaques in isolated housing and 41 in living arrangements of twos or
threes. After two months, they infected the animals with simian immunodeficiency virus. Within 14 days, the single
macaques showed a 21% higher viral load in their blood, along with 38% and 44% fewer virus-fighting white blood
cells —T cells and lymphocytes —than the socially housed animals (the macaques later received antiretroviral
drugs).
Why would our immune cells listen for loneliness, in effect making decisions that could make us sick, as well as
feeling emotionally rotten after heartbreak or isolation? Our internal defense forces can’t do everything at once,
explained Cole. It must take cues from our nervous system —for example, the release of stress hormones when we
feel threatened —and determine where to direct its resources.
In our deep evolutionary past, Cole said, being alone meant we were more likely to need to fight bacterial infection
from wounds, such as from an attacking predator. At the same time, we were less likely to need to fight viruses
that are spread mainly in groups of our own species. How do we best fight bacteria? With inflammation.
Unfortunately, this is exactly the wrong call for humans facing HIV, or, Cole added, for that matter, a novel virus.
And if isolation or loneliness lasts a long time, so will our heightened inflammation, potentially leading to chronic
disease.
“These are inconvenient biological responses to the way we live our life now,” said Cole.
We are vaxxed. We wear masks. And still I’m sitting in a chair in Echo Park listening to my mother cough through
the door, knowing we are on our own.
My blood cells after the marital explosion looked pretty inflammatory. Unfortunately, they also looked that way half
a year later. This was disappointing because I had been trying very hard to feel better. I’d even spent a month, with
friends and on my own, paddling a river in the wilderness. I thought my cells would like that. Maybe some of them
did, like the ones in my shoulder muscles. But my leukocytes? Not so much.
How long would it take for me and my cells to feel safer? This and other questions are worth raising, especially in
light of recent surges in loneliness driven by pandemic behavior. How quickly do the health effects of loneliness
set in? Are they reversible?
Recent studies with animals provide some hope, indicating the health effects of short-term loneliness —weeks or
months at a time —are largely reversible. For a study published in July in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences, Cole and colleagues conducted an experiment designed to mimic pandemic “lockdown.” They placed
21 adult male rhesus macaques in cages by themselves for two weeks. The animals behaved strangely, often lying
on the floor. Within 48 hours, they lost 30% to 50% of their virus-fighting white blood cells while ramping up their
inflammation-producing ones.
Fortunately, the animals’ immune cells returned to baseline after four weeks of living again in groups. There was
more good news. Curious to see whether companionship in lockdown would make a difference, the researchers
once again isolated macaques, but added an unrelated juvenile male to their cages (the age differential meant
there would be less hostility between them). The adults still lost some anti-viral white blood cells but didn’t make
as many pro-inflammatory cells. It’s likely their nervous systems weren’t as freaked out as when they were alone.
John Capitanio, the head of neuroscience and behavior at the California National Primate Research Center, sees
clear implications for humans in the research. “Some degree of social connection can really rescue people’s
immune systems from the negative effects of being forced to be isolated,” he told me.
My immune cells, too, seem to be looking shinier with the passage of time away from acute heartbreak and
loneliness. Although my first two blood draws indicated high levels of genes associated with inflammation, by the
third sample, almost two years after the split, those levels were trending down, a good thing. At the same time, it
looked like my body was producing a healthier profile of the white blood cells and other factors needed for viral
defense.
“You’re looking pretty good,” said Cole. “If it makes you feel better, the leukocytes are on your side.”
It made me feel better.
The monkeys and I were lucky. Chronic loneliness —and disease —hadn’t set in.

340,Being Alone Doesn't Have to Be Lonely: [Science Desk],"Sally Snowman loves to be alone. As the keeper of Boston Light, a centuries-old lighthouse on Little Brewster Island in Boston Harbor, she's had a lot of practice. For most of the last 19 years, she's lived there from April through October. 
She fills the days with work, cleaning the windows, mowing the lawn and sweeping the spiral staircase of the 90- foot lighthouse tower. She reads a lot and has watched a lot of sunsets. And she relishes every minute. ""It's a relief to be out on the island,"" Ms. Snowman, 70, said. When she's by herself, ""the wheels stop spinning."" Her time alone is restorative. 
But not everyone feels the same way about solitude, and for the last two years, the pandemic has forced some version of it upon us all. We've seen fewer friends and spent more time at home. Some people have found themselves feeling lonelier, particularly if they were already single or living alone. 
As we enter a new phase of the pandemic that's less ""wipe down your groceries"" and more ""welp, I guess this is our new normal,"" occasional periods of isolation may be something we just fold into our lives, like digital vaccination cards or having a dedicated drawer for masks. 
Whether you're hoping for more time alone or less these days, solitude is something you can learn to appreciate. Solitude is more enjoyable if you're in control of it. 
How we feel about time alone is largely dependent on whether we've chosen it, said Virginia Thomas, an assistant professor of psychology at Middlebury College who studies solitude. 
People who pursue solitude of their own volition ""tend to report that it feels full -- like they're full of ideas or thoughts or things to do,"" Dr. Thomas said. In this way, it's distinct from loneliness, a negative state in which you're ""disconnected from other people and it feels empty."" 
The key is to see solitude as a choice, not a punishment. In a 2019 survey, Dr. Thomas found that teenagers who deliberately sought out solitude showed higher levels of well-being and were less lonely than their peers who were alone just because of circumstances. The same was true in young adults ages 18 to 25, who also showed increased levels of personal growth and self-acceptance, and lower levels of depression. In fact, most research shows that we benefit more from solitude as we age, Dr. Thomas said, as we develop more control over our time, along with better cognitive and emotional skills to help us use it more constructively. 
Jenn Drummond, a mountaineer in Park City, Utah, has spent a lot of time alone as she trains to become the first woman to climb the Seven Second Summits, the second highest -- and generally more difficult -- mountains on each continent. If she catches herself ""getting into a mopey pattern,"" she reminds herself that she's in charge. ""Loneliness is happening to me,"" Ms. Drummond, 41, said. ""Solitude is happening for me. That little shift makes the biggest difference."" 
You can learn to like it, even if you're not an introvert. 
You might assume it's just introverts who benefit from solitude, but research is mixed on whether they are actually more skilled at being alone, Dr. Thomas said. In her view, ""anyone, with any personality, can enjoy it -- with one caveat: if they know how to use it well."" 
That means deciding what you want from your time, whether it's processing a tough situation, tapping into creativity or just enjoying five cumulative minutes without someone under five asking you for something. 
Without a goal ""we're just going to be throwing spaghetti at the wall, and that can elicit a false sense of failure, like 'Oh, I'm just not good at being alone,""' said Gina Moffa, a grief and trauma psychotherapist in New York City. Solitude can have a calming effect on our minds and bodies, which may be off-putting to people who usually equate happiness with feeling energized, Dr. Thomas said. They often just feel bored or restless. The key to dispelling the discomfort is to replace it with something enjoyable. If you don't know where to start, ""think of something you like doing in general, and then try doing it by yourself,"" Ms. Moffa said. And no, doom scrolling Twitter doesn't count as healthy solitude. In a 2020 study, Dr. Thomas followed 69 participants for a week, concluding that they were more emotionally satisfied with their solitude when they were truly alone, without their phones, than when they were alone but still on their phones. 
""If you want to connect with yourself or feel calm or creative, is scrolling social media going to get you what you need?"" she said. Most of the time, the answer is no. 
There are ways to make solitude easier. 
Former NASA astronaut Jim ""Ox"" van Hoften has experienced a very particular solitude; during his missions to space in the 1980s, he was isolated from his family, his routine and, quite literally, the world. And yet, ""there were only a few times I felt like I was really on my own,"" Dr. van Hoften, 77, said. Although the crew could reach ground control for only 20 minutes out of every 90-minute orbit, he still felt bolstered by support. Even in outer space, ""you're never alone, you always have somebody helping,"" he said. 
That applies on Earth too. Checking in with a friend can still be part of your solitude ritual, Ms. Moffa said. In fact, ""having the space to do that while we're in this place of solitude can make the communication deeper and the connection more authentic, because we're without the many layers of distractions around us."" You can also do a solitary activity but share it communally. Ms. Moffa is part of a group chat with friends who text each other their Wordle scores every day. ""We all do this thing quietly on our own, but it becomes something that connects us when we share it,"" she said. 
Solitude can also involve silence, which has been found to lower stress, improve sleep and help decision-making in some people. But without structure, it can feel intimidating, said Eloise Skinner, who spent a year training as a monk in a modern monastic community. 
Practice getting comfortable with silence during small moments in your day, first while actively doing something else -- like cooking or walking -- and then, for more of a challenge, while just sitting still. In the monastic community, ""all times of silence have a purpose to them,"" Ms. Skinner, 30, said. Adding a framework to your silence -- by writing in a journal or listening to your breath -- can make it more satisfying. 
If you just need to hear another voice, there's no shame in making it your own. Liz Thomas, 36, a professional long distance hiker who has backpacked 10,000 miles alone, gives herself pep talks using her trail name, Snorkel. ""I'll say, 'Come on, Snorkel, you've got to get this tent up,""' she said. Talking to herself in the second person soothes her worries, something researchers also found in a 2014 study. 
You can find solitude anywhere. 
Sally Snowman hasn't stayed overnight on Little Brewster Island since 2019. She still goes several times a week for routine maintenance, but the Coast Guard is in the process of transferring stewardship of the lighthouse and doesn't need her there as much. 
Recapturing the sense of calm she felt out there has been ""the ultimate challenge"" on the mainland, she said. She's started visiting a local park at off-peak hours, ""looking beyond the man-made aspects and just focusing on the trees."" Then she tries to bottle that peacefulness and contentment and bring it home. ""Find a place you feel connected to,"" she said. ""Then practice finding that place inside of you without literally having to go there.""

343,"To Enjoy Social Contact, Choice Matters; New research shows that people are least happy when they don't have control over whether to spend time alone or in a group","Psychologist Susan Pinker explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here .
Whether our homes became refuges or prisons over the last two years, there is no doubt that the pandemic
dramatically curtailed our social autonomy. We could no longer decide if and when to socialize, or even with whom.
If we were lucky enough to have a home, we were stuck with our fellow inmates.
Research just published in the Journal of Happiness Studies now reveals that when it comes to happiness, having
a choice is key. People who don't choose to be social but end up surrounded by other people rate themselves as
unhappiest. In contrast, folks who opt to be social and then find themselves in the company of others were
ecstatic.
""Our culture is so focused on how positive interactions can be—just think of FOMO—that we don't consider the
alternative,"" said the study's lead author Liad Uziel, a psychology professor at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. ""If you
choose to be in a social situation, then you are likely to get more out of it. But your well-being is likely to drop if you
didn't choose it.""
The study, published with fellow Bar-Ilan psychology professor Tomer Schmidt-Barad, recruited 155 university
students as participants. Every time the students received a text reminder on their phones, they had to report what
they were doing and with whom, if they had any control over who they were with, and how they felt about it all. As
Dr. Uziel described it: ""How satisfied were they—their positive and negative experiences at that moment, how
meaningful they found what was going on at that time, and how much control they had over the situation they
were in."" The participants were pinged three times a day for a total of 10 weekdays, which yielded a mountain of
data: 4,300 status reports.
Once the numbers were crunched, the researchers discerned several patterns. When people found themselves in
social environments, whether chosen or unchosen, participants' ratings of their experiences tended to the extreme,
with higher highs and lower lows. ""This means that our emotions are so much more intense when we're with other
people compared to when we're alone,"" Dr. Uziel said. Participants found themselves in environments they hadn't
chosen—such as classrooms and workplaces—about 30% of the time.
Being alone is more predictable, while being with others always presents surprises, he added. He used watching a
soccer game as an example: ""When you are alone and your team scores a goal, it's exciting. But it's way more
exciting if you're with other people—you experience it more powerfully."" This doesn't mean that time alone is to be
avoided, he said; the data show that ""the occasional period of time alone brings happiness to everyone, as long as
that person chooses it.""
Being with others also means having an audience, which heightens the impact of any experience. Performers know
this, as does anyone who has ever watched a 5-year-old learning to ride a bike. Having an audience witness your
achievement feels glorious. Of course, falling off your bike repeatedly is embarrassing when there's an audience.
These are the extremes of feeling that Dr. Uziel said were typical of social situations, whether or not they were
chosen.
His next project will be to look at how the pandemic has changed the meaning of social situations. ""It's a risk, even
for people who like to be with others,"" Dr. Uziel said. ""We shouldn't push people to socialize.""
This dictum, he suggested, should influence how we design workplaces and family homes: ""Give people as much
choice as possible. Because forcing social contact on people is just a source of stress.""

The stress of being pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic and the isolation resulting from lockdown and social distancing took a toll on her mental health and pushed her into ""panic mode,"" said the Commack teacher and first time mom, who was later diagnosed with postpartum anxiety. 
Dr. Brittain Mahaffey at Stony Brook University Hospital, who is working on a study of more than 7,400 women across the United States examining how pandemic-induced stress affects the health of new mothers and babies, said women who gave birth during the first two waves experienced increased anxiety, depression and OCD symptoms. Mahaffey estimates about one-third of women in the study reported they were ""highly stressed"" about the pandemic and many were concerned about altering their birth plans.  
Wendi Andria, a program director with Northwell Health, said women entered the delivery room more nervous, noting that although the hospital offered virtual prenatal classes, many didn't take them.  Northwell's popular baby cafe, a breastfeeding support group at South Shore and Cohen Children's hospitals, saw a drop in participation since it went virtual in March 2020, Andria said. After Northwell saw an increase in need for mental health resources for new moms, it amped up its postpartum outreach and enlisted baby cafe speakers to discuss mental health. The support group had 489 attendees in 2019, but numbers declined to 221 in 2020 and 144 in 2021, according to data provided by Northwell.  
""We had a very robust postpartum support group before COVID,"" Andria said. ""Our support group was so successful because moms that didn't even need help kept coming to support other moms. ... The peer support was what made it so successful,"" and that connection ""wasn't happening anymore."" 
WHAT TO KNOW 
Moms who gave birth during the pandemic experienced increased anxiety and mental health concerns. They lacked access to traditional support groups due to lockdown and social distancing. Finances, job security and the rising cost of baby care items compounded their stress. It is still very isolating and lonely
Sarah DeSalvo, 31, of Lindenhurst The lack of in-person support groups made it difficult for first-time mom Sarah DeSalvo, 31, of Lindenhurst, to befriend other moms. She hoped to meet women with babies the same age as her son, Lucien, who was born in July 2021. DeSalvo eventually joined the baby cafe in August. ""It is still very isolating and lonely,"" she said. ""There's times when I'm like, 'I would like to talk to another person.' "" While the pandemic took a toll on the moms, some also reported benefits. Health care workers found that
prohibiting visitors in the delivery room gave women more recovery time and uninterrupted time with their babies.  I FELT LIKE I WAS a terrible mom.
Jodie Abelson-Sommer, 32,Commack Abelson-Sommer was prescribed medication to cope with postpartum anxiety and insomnia. But needing to take the medication induced feelings of guilt, she said.  ""I felt like I was a terrible mom for needing to go on medicine,"" she said. ""I wish that a year ago I could have just looked up postpartum anxiety, and there would have been tons and tons of stories of people like me. . . . I didn't realize this was a real thing that people really suffer from, but nobody talks about."" 
She said her anxiety was caused by pandemic-related stress and fears of becoming ill with the virus, or dying. Isolation worsened her anxiety. After her daughter was born, she rarely left the house and socialized in person only with her husband and parents. She eventually joined online support groups for moms and signed up for virtual classes, but it was not the postpartum experience she'd envisioned. 
""I imagined all of my friends meeting my baby,"" she said. ""I imagined all of these experiences that we were going to have that weren't happening."" 
I feel like I was robbed of an experieNce. 
of Wheatley Heights Jackman gave birth to Nicholas in June 2020 when vaccines weren't available and tasks as simple as grocery shopping felt risky. 
""The hard part after birth was doing it all in isolation,"" said Jackman, who imagined frequent playdate and trips with her son. ""I'm a first-time mom, and not having a village there was very hard. When you think about having a baby, especially if it's your first, you imagine all of these different moments and experiences. . . . I feel like I was robbed of an experience."" 
She said childbirth amplified her pre-pandemic anxieties and disrupted her birth plan. She was also concerned by maternal mortality rates for Black women, who, studies show, are more than three times more likely to die while pregnant than white women. 
Like Jackman, new mom Stephanie Henriques, of Westbury, echoed concerns about mortality rates. As a doula and social worker, she was aware of health disparities Black women face. The first several months after she gave birth to her daughter were plagued with worries, Henriques said. She suffered from postpartum hypertension and wrestled with intrusive, or repetitive and unwanted thoughts, and sought medical help.  Jackman said her self-diagnosis of a ""postpartum identity crisis"" led her to pursue her doctorate in school district leadership. ""I think I was trying to claim some semblance of my former self,"" she said.  
Jackman also joined a support group at the Farmingdale-based Nesting Place. 
""You need a village,"" she said. ""There's a reason why for centuries women after giving birth were a community. . . . It's not meant to be done in isolation."" 
IT WAS A GODSEND' 
Tamara Serenita, 44 of Islip When Tamara Serenita's twin daughters, Amelia and Brenna, were born April 6, 2020, the state's stay-at-home order was extended. Soon afterward, her husband, a truck driver, was laid off. Around then, Serenita, 44, of Islip, started suffering from constant panic attacks. ""I didn't even know what was going on. . . . I remember very vividly pacing and I couldn't breathe,"" she said. 
Serenita also felt paranoid and suffered from insomnia, which, she said, she didn't experience after giving birth to her first child, Madeline, five years ago.  
Plans for daily outings to the zoo or beach, or ""Mommy and Me"" classes evaporated, which contributed to what she said was ""a touch of postpartum ."" Feeling lonely, Serenita joined the Nesting Place after posting about her

struggles on social media, where she bonded with other moms. 
""If it wasn't for all these online things, we literally would have been lost,"" she said. ""It helped to ease the feeling of loneliness. It was a godsend."" 
IT REALLY DOES TAKE A VILLAGE' 
Dr. Thalia Robakis, who co-leads the women's mental health program at Mt. Sinai Hospital, said even as we enter the ""new normal"" phase of the pandemic, isolation continues to be a problem for mothers who have children under 5 years old, since they cannot get vaccinated. That and other pandemic-related stressors create a ""domino effect"" for family members, she said.  
Robakis urged mothers not to ""suffer in silence"" in their mental health struggles and to seek out professional help. ""It's been this very extended long-term inability to access the normal supports that you would have for child care,"" she said. ""It really does take a village. That's not just something that somebody said. Suddenly in COVID, the village was gone, and it's been very difficult to resurrect.""Resources for new momsIf you're a new mother, or parent, who is struggling, resources are available for postpartum care, mental health, breastfeeding and more.  n Check with your OBGYN's office, or the hospital where you gave birth, to see what classes and groups they offer.  n The Parent Collective offers online education and support classes for moms.

349,Some good ways you can carve out 'alone time',"I have just turned off all the lights in my room and nestled in as the ominously velvet voice of Dateline NBC's Keith
Morrison introduces yet another husband who's totally up to no good, when I hear the tentative footsteps of an 8-
year-old outside my room.
""Mommy? Are you watching crime?""
""Sure am!"" I say, as my son's little feet retreat back down the stairs, because now he knows that it's officially
Mommy's True Crime Time, an hour of purposely kid-unsuitable programming that is mine alone. And I don't feel
bad about it. At all.
Parenting has never lent itself to alone time. But in our pandemic-worn, work-from-home, remote learning era,
finding creative ways to create that dedicated space, whether it's a solo walk or binge watch, is all the more
crucial. The issue is evergreen, pandemic or not: Parents are often in desperate need of some space, some quiet,
some way to recharge. The pandemic just heightened that need, and caregivers are finding ways to keep that
space going, even with kids back in school and adults back at work.
""Many of us internalize [the message] that parenting trumps all [and] everything is pushed aside,"" Minneapolis
clinical social worker Marit Appeldoorn says. ""But this [time] is not a luxury, not dispensable. We really have to give
ourselves permission to do our thing, even if it's just 10 minutes with a cup of coffee. It's good for physical health,
mental health and . . . good for our parenting.""
If the pandemic has been good for anything, perhaps learning to carve out some quiet time alone or with friends -
and not our children - is a true benefit. Finding time to be ourselves and re-energize after being caregivers to
everyone else is imperative, and many parents have found some ways to make that work.
Cynthia Ntini-Jacobson, 38, who lives in Chevy Chase, D.C., proves the tricky balance between Mom Time and Me
Time during this interview, as her 4-year-old son, Khozi kept adorably wandering into frame on the zoom. ""He said,
'Why are you sneaking around the house?' "" she says, once she's successfully shuffled him into another room.
Time alone was always hard to find because she home-schools Khozi and his 10-year-old brother, Khaya, but the
pandemic closed all of the museums and activities that provided ""a little reprieve, an outlet for being around other
people."" She finds refuge in her carefully curated Twitter feed, and in her 5 p.m. dinner prep time, during which the
kids and husband Paul, 43, know ""that's the time when I want to be left alone. I have my glass of rose and nobody
bothers me until I'm done.""
""I close the bedroom door and fold laundry and listen to podcasts,"" like ""You're Wrong About"" and ""The Office
Ladies,"" staying ""up long after I should just to get some time alone,"" says Jill Grundy, 39, who lives in Silver Spring,
Md., with husband Adam and kids Bennett, 10, Julia, 8 and Cecilia, 4. ""The other day I was folding laundry and Julia
said 'Can I help you? I really want to spend time with you.' I felt terrible, but I had to say 'This is my quiet time.' ""
Husband Adam, who, like Jill, is employed by the Census Bureau and has worked virtually since 2020, says he's
made time to go running with a neighbor each week, plays soccer regularly Sunday mornings and writes for a
music blog called Chorus.FM. ""These are things that I do just for fun, for me, that keep me sane,"" he says.
The judgment against taking time for oneself can be even harsher for dads, who some assume are traditionally
less hands-on in the first place and get to take a ""Father Knows Best""-like rest in a recliner with a pipe while Mom
does everything else. Cris Avery, 37, who was his 12-year-old daughter Nya's primary caregiver for much of her life
and now shares custody with his ex-wife in Brooklyn, says it sometimes seems like people have to be convinced he
needs it.
""There were many 'Moms Surviving The Pandemic' groups but they weren't specifically for dads. They were like,
'Well, it's kinda good you're taking care of your daughter,' and I was her primary caregiver,"" he says.
Because of that ""layer of invisibility"" in being a single dad, ""as well as being a Black transman,"" Avery has found
refuge as a content creator on the Bigo Live app, which has become ""part of my escape to talk about being a dad,
and help connecting with other parents trapped in the house.""
Instead of getting the kids out of the house, Kara Higgins, 43, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, actually added two to her
previous brood of four - a Japanese exchange student who came to the States in fall 2019 and stayed, and a foster
baby who came as ""a pandemic surprise"" right around Mother's Day in 2020. Higgins and her husband, Ryan, are
now in the process of adopting her.
Higgins, who works in health care and risks covid-19 exposure on the job, sought out activities that give her
dedicated time for herself and ""not expose other people to all my cooties,"" she says. One is a live fitness class app
called Open Fit, ""where I found an online community working out with other people. I needed to be distant but I'm
also an extrovert, so it's a way to have some community. It's been really great.""
Of course, with that much work responsibility and that many people in her house, there are times ""where I try to
disconnect."" The practice started in the beginning of the pandemic where she ""would strip down naked and tell the
kids, 'Let me get a shower and get the covid off me. Give me a few minutes and I'll be ready.' Now everyone knows
my boundaries. And I find it's really important to not feel ashamed or guilty if I need to go for an hour to be by
myself.""
There doesn't seem to be a template or a rule for how to get that time, as long as it's time set aside away from the
kids. For Janet Max, 45, of Takoma Park, Md., it was a regular walk with neighbors ""for the first solid five months of
the pandemic. We'd get a text that said 'See you on the corner' and we went,"" she says. ""Those walks were my
savior.""
Kelly Durkin, 33, a mother of three in Columbia, ""has definitely been on a podcast tangent,"" along with TV binges
with husband Scott for shows like ""Outlander"" and the ""Sex and The City"" reboot ""And Just Like That . . ."" She
sometimes eludes her kids using chores as a cover. ""I'm like, 'Gotta go fold laundry! So sorry!'""
She, of course, is not sorry, and social worker Appeldoorn says that's the right attitude. She lists our current
societal Wordle obsession as ""the best example of collective play I've seen in the 10 years. Self-care is anything
that helps our nervous systems feel safe and reset, and also gives us fuel in our tanks that we need in order to
keep at it. Just taking breaks is not enough anymore. There's nothing selfish about it. And whatever it is, it has to
be for you.""

360,An extrovert doesn't understand his partner's need for alone time,"Adapted from an online discussion.Hi Carolyn: I am an introvert who, when I was single, was able to go all weekend without talking to somebody. Occasional dates, phone calls with friends, even running to CVS was enough social interaction until I was back in the office on Monday. For the past four years I've been living with an extrovert who loves my company (go figure!). LOTS of covid quality time together has made me think about how much time we are ""supposed"" to spend with partners. I am good about getting the me-time I NEED - I am also generally happy reading for hours - but I feel guilty knowing my partner is sitting in the living room alone. I also have other solitary hobbies like writing and gaming (which he has no interest in), and when we argue, he'll say things like, ""You're always in there reading or playing games,"" so I know it bugs him. I think even when he is sitting alone working on his laptop, he'd appreciate me being in the same room with him to exchange an anecdote or keep him company. In some ways he reminds me of my aging mother, who always needed someone in the room with her, or maybe I am the loyal dog he needs by his side? When we talk about it, he says he just doesn't ""get"" the introvert ""thing"" so I feel as if I'm either not being a good partner (by enjoying what is probably more than a ""normal"" amount of alone time) and feeling a little resentment, like, ""Dude, we spent the whole day together, can't you find something on Netflix to watch?"" Any idea on how to negotiate or strike the ""right"" balance of alone time? Or maybe we are just not a match. 
- Introvert 
Introvert: Why doesn't he ""get"" the introvert ""thing?"" You ""get"" the extrovert ""thing,"" enough. You don't have to feel it to know it exists, right? 
You know there are two terms for two different general emotional makeups, and you are one of them, so you have no reason to believe the other one is just some made-up thing. Right? 
So have you asked him why he, with the same grasp of the vocabulary, can't just take on faith that you fit the other description? 
I guess this is under my skin because you're taking care of yourself emotionally, AND you're trying to take care of him. And I don't see the same effort from him to make sure you're getting what you need. So if you want to try discussing it again, then that's where I'd start: by saying you're introverted and alone-timish but try to be mindful of supplying him the companionship he needs. And you'd appreciate it if he returned the favor and were also mindful of facilitating - or just accepting - your alone time instead of resisting it. As for the ""supposed to"" of time spent with partners, there's no such thing. The right amount of together time is when you feel good about the amount of together time - not guilty, not smothered, not lonely, not weary from begging, and not arm-weary from having to hold your lines all the time.

364,"Inmate Suicides Rose Sharply in U.S. Prisons, Jails During Pandemic; More inmates kill themselves amid pandemic isolation, increased use of drugs, staff shortages","Suicides in prisons and jails across the U.S. have risen sharply over the past two years, data collected by The Wall
Street Journal show, a trend that officials and inmate advocates say is driven in part by the increased isolation of
inmates during the pandemic, more abuse of drugs including fentanyl and staff shortages.
In the Texas prison system last year, 61 inmates took their own lives, the most in two decades. In Louisiana, 13
state prison inmates died by suicide from January 2021 through the beginning of October, more than triple the
number during the prior three years combined. Kentucky prisons have seen six suicides so far in 2022, compared
with one last year.
Local jails have seen a similar rise. At the Louisville, Ky., jail, five inmates killed themselves over the past 11
months, compared with none in 2018, 2019 and 2020. In New York City correctional facilities, which include Rikers
Island , one of the nation's largest detention centers, there were four suicides in 2021 compared with one the prior
two years.
Prison and jail officials in several states said that they are making extensive efforts to assist offenders with mental
health and self-harm issues and that rising suicides coincided with the onset of the pandemic .
In addition to being confined to their cells for extended time during Covid-19 outbreaks , inmates often weren't able
to meet with family members as visits were curtailed during the pandemic.
""The amount of isolation that people are experiencing is greater than before,"" said Susan Pollitt, supervising
attorney with Disability Rights North Carolina, an advocacy group focused on discrimination, abuse and other
rights violations, including in prisons.
Recent data from some prison and jail systems has shown suicide deaths increasing this year even as the
pandemic has waned and many facilities have restored visitation.
Deaths by suicide are up in the general population as well. The suicide rate in the U.S. rose 4% in 2021 , after two
years of decline, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dave Kratz, director of the Bucks County Department of Corrections in Pennsylvania, where three inmates died by
suicide this year compared with one last year, said there are fewer corrections officers to deal with inmates
addicted to powerful fentanyl-laced drugs that have become more common in recent years.
Out of every 400 new inmates, 250 to 280 require detox protocols that take about nine days, Mr. Kratz said,
compared with two or three days in years past. At the same time, he has 70 vacancies for corrections officers,
compared with 20 to 30 before the pandemic, resulting in more mandatory overtime.
Mr. Kratz said he has converted 60 cells in the past several years to be suicide-resistant by taking away bedsheets
and other measures. This week, he is opening a unit for up to 90 inmates who are in acute detox or a mental-health
crisis so guards can check them more efficiently.
""This is not a flash in the pan with these detoxes and mental-health issues,"" Mr. Kratz said. ""This is going to be with
us for a while.""
Last December, Stephanie Dunbar, a Louisville jail inmate in detox, killed herself after being locked in a small
holding room for 18 hours because there were no single cells available, according to the report of a city
investigator and an attorney for Ms. Dunbar's family.
The city investigator found that jail officers forged reports saying they checked on Ms. Dunbar as required when
they hadn't, and that she was never allowed to use a toilet or sink, among other failings. The investigator called the
events surrounding Ms. Dunbar's isolation a complete breakdown of the system.
In March, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer appointed a new head of the city's corrections department. Earlier this
year, the mayor also hired a jail-safety consultant to conduct a review of the system. The consultant found that
cells were poorly lighted and not suicide-resistant and that the department wasn't tracking suicide deaths or
attempts. He said the department should reduce its use of isolation cells.
Major Darrell Goodlett, a spokesman for the city corrections department, said it can't comment on recent specific
suicides because of ongoing litigation.
Major Goodlett said the new director recognizes that suicide is a serious threat and has made a number of
changes, including renovating cells to make them more suicide-resistant, increasing mental-health services and
suicide screening and appointing a psychologist to his senior staff. For the first time in several years, a psychiatric
nurse practitioner and a psychiatrist are seeing inmates regularly, Major Goodlett said.
The surge in inmate suicides follows a steady rise for nearly two decades before the pandemic. According to a
report released last year by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of suicides
increased 85% in state prisons, 61% in federal prisons, and 13% in local jails from 2001 to 2019.
At the same time, federal prisons saw a decline in suicides this past fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, dropping
to 18 from 33 in fiscal 2021. The federal Bureau of Prisons said its facilities had reduced the number of inmates
housed in cells by themselves, which contributed to the decrease in suicides.
In Texas, inmate advocates say insufficient mental-health services and a staffing shortage have contributed to
inmates spending more time in their cells. The 61 suicides in Texas prisons last year were up from 50 in 2020 and
35 in 2019.
Amanda Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said the department last fiscal
year implemented a system to help identify inmates especially vulnerable to suicide and has created a network of
offices dedicated to preventing self-harm.
The department currently has nearly 6,900 correctional-officer positions vacant, she said.
Sharon McKinney, executive director of the Texas Incarcerated Families Association, said inmates her group was
in touch with were struggling to receive psychological help.

373,We are spending scary amounts of time alone. Can we stop ourselves?,"The covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on our social lives. Cancellations, closures and fear of a potentially deadly
infection led us to hunker down and avoid acquaintances, co-workers and extended family. Time spent with friends
went down. Time spent alone went up.
Thanksgiving was not spared. Americans spent 38 percent less time with friends and extended family over the
Thanksgiving weekend in the past two years than they had a decade prior.
And now for the scarier news: Our social lives were withering dramatically before covid-19. Between 2014 and
2019, time spent with friends went down (and time spent alone went up) by more than it did during the pandemic.
According to the Census Bureau's American Time Use Survey, the amount of time the average American spent with
friends was stable, at 6 1/2 hours per week, between 2010 and 2013. Then, in 2014, time spent with friends began
to decline.
By 2019, the average American was spending only four hours per week with friends (a sharp, 37 percent decline
from five years before). Social media, political polarization and new technologies all played a role in the drop. (It is
notable that market penetration for smartphones crossed 50 percent in 2014.)
Covid then deepened this trend. During the pandemic, time with friends fell further - in 2021, the average American
spent only two hours and 45minutes a week with close friends (a 58 percent decline relative to 2010-2013).
Similar declines can be seen even when the definition of ""friends"" is expanded to include neighbors, co-workers
and clients. The average American spent 15 hours per week with this broader group of friends a decade ago, 12
hours per week in 2019 and only 10 hours a week in 2021.
On average, Americans did not transfer that lost time to spouses, partners or children. Instead, they chose to be
alone.
No single group drives this trend. Men and women, White and non-White, rich and poor, urban and rural, married
and unmarried, parents and non-parents all saw proportionally similar declines in time spent with others. The
pattern holds for both remote and in-person workers.
The percentage decline is also similar for the young and old; however, given how much time young people spend
with friends, the absolute decline among Americans age 15 to 19 is staggering. Relative to 2010-2013, the average
American teenager spent approximately 11 fewer hours with friends each week in 2021 (a 64 percent decline) and
12 additional hours alone (a 48 percent increase).
These new habits are startling - and a striking departure from the past. Just a decade ago, the average American
spent roughly the same amount of time with friends as Americans in the 1960s or 1970s. But we have now begun
to cast off our connections to each other.
It is too soon to know the long-term consequences of this shift, but it seems safe to assume that the decline of our
social lives is a worrisome development. Spending less time with friends is not a best practice by most standards,
and it might contribute to other troubling social trends - isolation, worsening mental health (particularly among
adolescents), rising aggressive behavior and violent crime. Americans rate activities as more meaningful and
joyful when friends are present. Friends and social connections build on themselves and produce memories and
fellowship. They also boost health and lead to better economic outcomes.
We can hope, as covid-related barriers recede, that people will change course. Time with friends did increase in
2021 after the vaccine rolled out; however, at the end of 2021, it was still an hour below the 2019 level.
Furthermore, a Pew Research Center survey made public in August suggests that covid might have changed us
permanently - 35 percent of Americans say that participating in large gatherings, going out and socializing in-
person have become less important since the pandemic.
The potential harms of these trends are sufficient to demand that Americans devote some resources to
understanding and reversing them.
You can help reverse these trends today without waiting for the researchers and policymakers to figure it all out.
It's the holidays: Don't skip time with your family. Go to that holiday party (or throw one yourself). Go hang out with
friends for coffee, or a hike, or in a museum, or a concert - whatever. You will feel better, create memories, boost
your health, stumble across valuable information - and so will your companions.

374,"We heard from the nation's top doctor on loneliness, isolation and what to do if you catch COVID [Corrected 12/11/2022]","What do young people most often say to the U.S. surgeon general when he asks them about their health?
They say that they are anxious and lonely, Vice Adm. Vivek Murthy told us during a Thursday visit to the Tribune's
Editorial Board.
He noted the irony of how those feelings of isolation are never more evident than when young Americans are using
social media. It's a relatively recent phenomenon, said the nation's top doctor, that has an impact precisely the
opposite of what previously was understood by the word ""social.""
According to Murthy, a smart, warm and highly articulate person who struck us as a viable candidate for further
public office in the future, young people tell him they feel bad about themselves because they feel compelled to
retreat into their phones, and begin comparing themselves with others with greater achievements, or who appear
to be doing cooler things.
While jumping off the platform may sound like the obvious solution, and the one most frequently advocated by
their parents, they say that only makes things worse because the departure then makes them even more anxious
that they are missing out. In other words, it's a Catch-22. Social media always wins.
""These sites were developed by some of the smartest engineers and technicians out there, and they were designed
to maximize engagement time on the platforms,"" he said. ""How can we expect our young people to compete with
them?""
How, indeed? Murthy argued that the government long has seen fit to ensure basic safety standards for the
common items that are brought into our homes, such as refrigerators or stoves. But social media channels have
been allowed to proliferate and consume so much of an American youth without any such oversight.
This situation, he said, is the cause of far more of our problems than we currently realize. And it needs fixing. We
hope he prevails over the resistance that those sites are sure to mount.
It is axiomatic that America has a mental health crisis, and that this nation feels lonelier than ever. But it was
striking that Murthy did not ascribe this situation entirely to the COVID-19 crisis, even if he allowed that it
exacerbated the growing problem.
Rather, he cited multiple interconnected causes for the malaise, including the cruel judgments of social media, the
chaotic pace of our lives, the ubiquity of ideological conflict and our increased ability to recognize mental health
issues that long have been present, and discuss them with newly acquired language.
The other part of his message was that isolation is not, well, an isolated problem.
Take, for example, the matter of emergency preparedness, something all Americans should consider.
If you have a serious accident at home, for example, your ability to get the vital help you need fast likely will depend
on how well you know your neighbors, Murthy said. If you're well-connected, they could be your first responders.
Much attention is paid to making sure ambulances show up in a timely fashion, far less to whether or not there is a
neighbor for everyone to call when they are in trouble.
And, Murthy said, there is compelling evidence that isolation and loneliness also means an increased risk of heart
disease, dementia and other serious health problems.
And what of the state of COVID? ""We'd all like to be able to turn the page on COVID,"" Murthy said, dryly. ""But it's still
there.""
Given the political nature of his position, it was not surprising when he noted that he'd only joined the
administration of President Joe Biden after the realization had dawned that keeping schools closed was having a
seriously detrimental impact on kids, something initially panicked state and local governments had been slow to
see.
But he also noted that allowing the ""political polarization"" of the debate over all of the COVID-19 issues brought
dire consequences.
We will go further than the surgeon general. The reckless politicization of the crisis will be seen by historians as
one of America's greatest public health mistakes.
The good news? If you are fully vaccinated and up to date on your booster shots, and you take the Pfizer
medication Paxlovid within five days of catching the virus, Murthy said, then your chances of hospitalization or
death are ""shockingly low,"" and this applies even if you are in a high-risk group.
He noted that there was more work to be done in educating physicians as to that equation. And, since there were
several COVID survivors in our meeting, he argued that it was a mistake not to take the medication if your
symptoms appeared, because the virus does not peak and ebb in traditional fashion, and interaction with other
medications can almost always be managed. Not taking the medicine while it is within its effectiveness window
might mean that you have one less weapon on your side if things worsen.
And, Murthy said, there is growing evidence that the severity of your bout with COVID has an impact on the
likelihood of your developing so-called long COVID, a phenomenon, he said, about which there still is much to learn.
In the end, the advice was simple.
Put down the phone and computer and, just as crucially, force yourself not to think about what you might be
missing (pro tip: nothing of lasting import). Cultivate friendships, suspend anxiety-causing judgments and reach
out to those with different views. Get to know your neighbors and discuss what you might do for each other should
the need arise. Walk the dog.
Ensure that you are up to date with boosters. And should COVID come knocking at your door, don't panic but take
your medicine in a timely fashion.",12/11/22,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,neither,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,4
375,End isolation for Cook County's youth [Corrected 12/11/2022],"""Being alone kind of messes me up. I don't got nobody to talk to. I need interaction,"" a young person incarcerated
at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) told investigators looking into the conditions at
the facility
That account is included in a report from a blue ribbon committee convened by Cook County Chief Judge Timothy
Evans in April 2021 is nothing short of horrific. A rational person after reading the report would push to close the
facility -- the largest stand-alone juvenile jail in the country -- and replace it with smaller community-based settings
that provide restorative and rehabilitative care.
It's what the members of the committee recommended. But that's not what Evans, Superintendent Leonard Dixon
and other officials did. Instead, the report was hidden from the public for three months until it was suddenly
released following reporter inquiries. First, Evans suggested he'd form a committee to review the
recommendations. Then, two months later, he announced promised actions that only partially address the report's
recommendations.
These youths don't need another committee or promises of changes in the future. They need humane living
conditions, social interaction and trauma-informed care. And they need it now.
Over the past three years, as the COVID-19 pandemic has lingered, experts clamored for schools to stay open,
arguing about how crucial in-person social engagement is for the development and well-being of children and
youth. Yet, that same urgency is missing for our county's most vulnerable youth, those in juvenile custody, who are
disproportionately Black and brown.
According to the report, youths at JTDC spend at least 13 hours each day isolated from other people. Many spend
more than that on any given day as solitary confinement is used as punishment, often arbitrarily.
""Staff can put you in your room as much as they want without telling why or how long you will be there,"" said one
youth.
Another: ""Nobody wants to stay in their room. Staff uses room confinement to control us.""
Significant research in recent years has detailed the harmful effects of confinement in juvenile justice facilities. A
2012 report from the U.S. Attorney General's Task Force on Children Exposed to Violence noted, ""Nowhere is the
damaging impact of incarceration on vulnerable children more obvious than when it involves solitary
confinement.""
The harm caused by confinement and isolation risks lifelong consequences as the youth in detention are still
developing and maturing. The part of the brain that enables us to plan, organize our thoughts and use good
judgment in difficult situations doesn't reach maturation until age 25.
""The experience of isolation is especially frightening, traumatizing and stressful for juveniles. These traumatic
experiences can interfere with and damage these essential developmental processes, and the damage may be
irreparable,"" Craig Haney, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz, told the Atlantic in
2014.
And yet, rather than focus on rehabilitative services that support positive development, the Cook County juvenile
criminal legal system is anchored by punitive, harmful practices that compound trauma and adverse childhood
experiences.
There may be youth who need to remain at a secure facility while awaiting trial or disposition of their case.
However, the current JTDC, which resembles an adult facility more than anything else, is not where those youth
should be kept. All youth under the care of Cook County -- regardless of what actions resulted in their detention --
should be housed in small, humane settings.
There is money to do this. The state allocated more than $5 million to Cook County through the Redeploy Illinois
program to provide alternative housing and services for young people in detention.
We need Evans, Dixon and county officials to act now to keep their promises and to stop the harm being done to
our county's youth.",12/11/22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,only risks,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,only risks,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,2,3
